# Nested inner hits

You just saw how to create nested objects.

Specifically, you saw how to match departments with employees matching some criteria.

That's pretty useful.

But what if you want to know which employees cost?

The department to match the search results from the previous lecture didn't include any information to help us with this, but fortunately it's very easy to get a hold of this information.

We do that by using a feature called Inner Hits.

As you will see later in a hit can also be used with the join data type.

So when we use inner hits in the context of a nested field, we refer to the feature as nested inner hits.

Let's take the query from the previous lecture and see how we can instruct Elasticsearch to include the nested inner hits.

```
GET /department/_search
{
  "_source": false,
  "query": {
    "nested": {
      "path": "employees",
      "inner_hits": {},
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "match": {
                "employees.position": "intern"
              }
            },
            {
              "term": {
                "employees.gender.keyword": {
                  "value": "F"
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
In the simplest form, all we have to do is to add an option named inner underscore hits to the query.

That's it.

Let's do that and check out the results.

So I'm just going to add the option within the nested objects right here.

So inner underscore hits, oops hits and just specify an empty object as the value and that's it.

Before running the query, I'll just do so that the source documents for the departments will not be returned.

That's just to make the results easier to read as we will see quite a bit of data.

Otherwise, if you don't do this, you will of course still have access to the matching departments as before.

So I'll just go up here and set underscore source.

So false.

And now we can run the query.

```
{
  "took" : 12,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 2,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 2.3905568,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "department",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 2.3905568,
        "inner_hits" : {
          "employees" : {
            "hits" : {
              "total" : {
                "value" : 1,
                "relation" : "eq"
              },
              "max_score" : 2.3905568,
              "hits" : [
                {
                  "_index" : "department",
                  "_type" : "_doc",
                  "_id" : "1",
                  "_nested" : {
                    "field" : "employees",
                    "offset" : 3
                  },
                  "_score" : 2.3905568,
                  "_source" : {
                    "gender" : "F",
                    "name" : "Julie Powell",
                    "position" : "Intern",
                    "age" : 26
                  }
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "department",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "2",
        "_score" : 2.3905568,
        "inner_hits" : {
          "employees" : {
            "hits" : {
              "total" : {
                "value" : 2,
                "relation" : "eq"
              },
              "max_score" : 2.3905568,
              "hits" : [
                {
                  "_index" : "department",
                  "_type" : "_doc",
                  "_id" : "2",
                  "_nested" : {
                    "field" : "employees",
                    "offset" : 2
                  },
                  "_score" : 2.3905568,
                  "_source" : {
                    "gender" : "F",
                    "name" : "Margaret Harris",
                    "position" : "Intern",
                    "age" : 19
                  }
                },
                {
                  "_index" : "department",
                  "_type" : "_doc",
                  "_id" : "2",
                  "_nested" : {
                    "field" : "employees",
                    "offset" : 7
                  },
                  "_score" : 2.3905568,
                  "_source" : {
                    "gender" : "F",
                    "name" : "Evelyn Henderson",
                    "position" : "Intern",
                    "age" : 24
                  }
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
So within the results, we now have a key named inner underscore hits.

Within this key we can find a key named employees, which matches the path that we defined within the search query.

If you want, you can configure this by specifying a name option for the inner underscore hits objects.

The rest of the results should look pretty familiar to you for the most part.

Within the hidden subjects, we can see how many nested objects were matched for a given department.

Remember that we're dealing with a single department here being the one with an ID of one.

This department had one employee that matched the criteria.

We can find that particular employee within the nested hit subjects, which is an array of the employees that matched our nested crew.

In this case, an employee named Julie Powell matched our criteria.

Apart from us being able to access the employee objects within the underscore source key.

Notice how there's also an underscore nested objects.

This object has a field key which tells us which nested object the hit came from.

In this case, that equals the path that we defined because we're only searching one type of nested objects in our query.

But that might not always be the case for more complex queries.

If we scroll down a bit, we can find the other department that matched the query, along with the employees that were matched for the nested field.

For this department, two employees matched.

That's really all there is to nested inner hits.

As you can see in starting Elasticsearch, to return them is super easy and it's a powerful way to get some insight into which nested objects cost a document to match.

This may or may not be relevant to you depending on your particular use case.

Before ending this lecture, I want to quickly mention two things.

The first thing is that by default, the inner hits are sorted by their relevant scores.

That's perfectly fine in most cases, but if you need to, you can sort the inner hits by specifying a sort option within the inner underscore hits objects.

Chances are that you will never need to do this, so I won't dive deeper into that.

The second thing I want to mention is that the inner hits supports some features, some of which you haven't seen yet.

These include highlighting source filtering, script fields and the Explain API.

The latter can be used to understand why given hit matched and why it was caught the way it was.

And with that, let's move on to the next lecture.
