# Multi-level relations

So far we have only been working with one level of relations, but it's also possible to have so-called multilevel or nested relations in the context of the example that we have been working with so far.

![](images/2022-09-21_14-57)

We could have a company containing departments which in turn have employees.

But just to avoid having to update the mapping of our existing index, I'm going to create a new one for this lecture.

I'll name it company, and it's going to contain the relations that are just mentioned, along with a supplier relation that belongs to a company.

That one really has nothing to do with multi-level relations.

But that's just to show an example of one relation containing multiple relation types, which I mentioned earlier in this section.

All right, so let's get started creating the index and the mapping.

## Creating the index with mapping

```
PUT /company
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "join_field": { 
        "type": "join",
        "relations": {
          "company": ["department", "supplier"],
          "department": "employee"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
First, we need to define the company relation type, which is going to contain both a department and supplier relation type, hence why the value will be an array.

So let's add a key named company.

Oops company and an array as the value being an array of strings.

So first departments and then supplier.

You saw the same thing earlier, although at that time we only specified one relation type as the value.

All right.

So all we need to do now is to define that an employee should be a child of a department.

We can do that by adding another key name department, matching the child of the company relation type that we already defined.

So let's do that.

Departments and a string value.

So hopefully you can see that the key matches the child of the company relation above.

The value is going to be the relation type exactly as you have seen before.

So in this case, it's going to be employee.

All right.

So let me just recap on what this does, because it can look a bit confusing at first.


We have a company relation, which is the parent relation for both the Department and Supply Relations.

So a company can have multiple departments and suppliers.

Now we define that a company can have multiple employees, which adds another level of relations than what you've seen before.

We did that by specifying the name of an existing relation type as to key within the relation subject and then just define the child relation type in the same way as you've seen before.

This leaves us with relations matching the three structure that you saw in the diagram earlier.

Let's go ahead and run the query, because then I want to show you how to add documents to the new relation.
```
{
  "acknowledged" : true,
  "shards_acknowledged" : true,
  "index" : "company"
}
```
All right.

So now the index has been created.

Let me scroll down because I have a few queries down here.

So I've prepared the queries that add a company and a department in advance because those are exactly the same as the queries that you saw in the previous lecture.

Let's run these two queries, first of all.
## Adding a company

```
PUT /company/_doc/1
{
  "name": "My Company Inc.",
  "join_field": "company"
}
```

## Adding a department

```
PUT /company/_doc/2?routing=1
{
  "name": "Development",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "department",
    "parent": 1
  }
}
```

All right.

That lets us focus on the important part being to add an employee.

## Adding an employee

```
PUT /company/_doc/3?routing=1
{
  "name": "Bo Andersen",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "employee",
    "parent": 2
  }
}
```
I've prepared this career in advance as well, except for the routing query parameter and the parent option.

And in fact, so does the parent option, which should contain the ID of the department it belongs to.

That would be true in this case.

So let's just go ahead and fill that out.

So I'll go down here and set the parent option to two.

What's new is the routing query parameter, because this should no longer be the ID of the parent document.

In our mapping, an employee is a grandchild of a company.

What we need to do is to specify the ID of the grandparent of the document, which is the company that the department belongs to.

In this example, the company has an ID of one, so let's enter that as the value.

Like.

![](images/2022-09-21_15-02)

So we're doing this for the same reason as before being that we need the document to be routed to the correct shard.

But when using multiple levels of relations, you need to root to the shard that contains the document at the highest level of the document hierarchy.

All right.

And let's run this query as well.

All right.

So now that you've seen how to index documents in the context of multi-level relations, what about searching for them?

The answer to that question is quite simple.

You do it in the same way as you've already seen, i.e.

by using the clues that you saw in the past couple of lectures, namely the has underscored parents, has underscored children and parent underscore ID queries.

They work no differently in the context of multilevel relations because they just operate on a relation between two types.

The queries are not concerned with where in the hierarchy these types are placed, so they work in exactly the same way.

That being said, you might need to nest the queries if you want to restrict the match documents on multiple relation levels.

So let me give you an example of how that can be done.

Before getting into the example, I just want to quickly add a few more documents so I can actually prove that the following query is going to work.

## Adding some more test data
```
PUT /company/_doc/4
{
  "name": "Another Company, Inc.",
  "join_field": "company"
}
```

```
PUT /company/_doc/5?routing=4
{
  "name": "Marketing",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "department",
    "parent": 4
  }
}
```

```
PUT /company/_doc/6?routing=4
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "employee",
    "parent": 5
  }
}
```

So I'm just going to run a couple of queries that I've already prepared, which just add a new company with a marketing department with an employee named John Doe.

So let's run this free.

Great.

Now we have a bit more data to work with.

Suppose that we want to retrieve the companies with an employee named John Doe, since the employee type is a grandchild of the company type.

We need to do a bit more work than just using the Hess underscore child query since we have the department type in between.

So more explicitly, we want to find companies containing at least one department which has an employee named John Doe.

Let's get started building that query.

The first step is to use the Hess underscore child query for the department type because we want to find the companies that have departments matching a given query will define a query in a moment.

So let's get started typing out the query.

## Example of querying multi-level relations

```
GET /company/_search
{
  "query": {
    "has_child": {
      "type": "department",
      "query": {
        "has_child": {
          "type": "employee",
          "query": {
            "term": {
              "name.keyword": "John Doe"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
So gets.

Company and search API as always query objects and the Haskell query.

So the type is going to be departments.

And now let's get to work on the query objects.

So now we have to define the constraints for the departments.

Or actually we don't want to put any constraints on the departments themselves, but rather they are relationship to employees.

So we want to match departments that contain employees, which is a perfect fit for the Hess underscored child query once again.

So what we will actually do is to nest the Hess underscore child query within a has underscore child query while it may sound and look strange at first.

Let's go ahead and type it out and I'll explain that afterwards.

So I'll add another Haskell query here.

I'll set the type to employee because now we're going to add a constraint to the employee document type or relation type.

Within this new query object, we can add constraints to the employees that we want to match, as I just mentioned.

In this case, I'll just search for the employee name John Doe, so I'll use the term query and the keyword mapping.

So let's add a term query here.

So the field is name and I'll use the keyword mapping and specify John Doe as the value.

And that's it.

Before running the query, let's take a moment to recap on what this query does, since I understand that it may look a bit confusing.

The first Hess underscore child query finds any company that contains departments that match the query.

In this case, that query is another has underscore child query, which finds employees with the name John Doe.

So if the innermost has underscore child query returns at least one document i.e.

employee the department is included in the outermost has underscored child query, causing the company to be included within the results.

Hopefully that makes sense.

Let's try to run the query and check the results.

```
{
  "took" : 655,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "company",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "4",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "Another Company, Inc.",
          "join_field" : "company"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
As we can see, a company is much more specifically the company that I added a moment ago.

The first company is not matched because it does not contain any departments where an employee named John Doe works.

Let's try to change the name to my name and see what happens.
```
GET /company/_search
{
  "query": {
    "has_child": {
      "type": "department",
      "query": {
        "has_child": {
          "type": "employee",
          "query": {
            "term": {
              "name.keyword": "Bo Andersen"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
```
{
  "took" : 0,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "company",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "My Company Inc.",
          "join_field" : "company"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Now we can see that the other company is matched instead.

And if I change the name to my name, we should see that no company is matched.

So let's do that.

```
GET /company/_search
{
  "query": {
    "has_child": {
      "type": "department",
      "query": {
        "has_child": {
          "type": "employee",
          "query": {
            "term": {
              "name.keyword": "Fatma"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
```
{
  "took" : 0,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 0,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  }
}
```
And indeed, no company is match now.

All right, that's it.

That's how to both define and query multi-level relations.

You just saw an example of how to query a multilevel relationship, but you can use the cruise that you've already seen how you wish.

Depending on which kind of data you're working with and which kind of data you want to retrieve.
