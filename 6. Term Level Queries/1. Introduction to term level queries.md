# 1. Introduction to term level queries

It's time to start learning some more crude losses that you can use when searching for documents.

We covered quite a bit of theory until now, both in regards to the Elasticsearch architecture, but also in the previous sections where we covered analyzers mapping and introduction to searching.

Now it's really time to get to it and run some queries against our cluster.

In this section, we'll be looking at a group of credit losses called Term Level Cruz, which I introduced in the previous section.

These are most commonly used for clearing structure data, such as dates and numbers.

You can use term level queries for querying text fields to, as you will see.

For instance, you can search a status field for the term active, which is good use of a term level query.

But searching a description field for whatever a user insert within the search fields is not something you would use term level queries for.

That's because some level queries find exact matches, which we talked about at the end of the previous section.

Instead, one would perform full text queries in such scenarios, which we'll look at in the next section.

For now, let's get going with some term level queries that require exact matches.
