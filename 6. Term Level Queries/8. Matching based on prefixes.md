Apart from matching documents that contain a given term for our fields with the term query, we can also look for terms that begin with a given prefix.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the query that enables us to do that is named prefix.

More specifically, the prefix query matches documents that contain a term within a given field that begins with a given prefix.

This means that the query is not limited to searching fields concerning a single term, but it will also match a document that has ten words within the field.

If any of the terms begin with the specified prefix, let's see that in action by searching the text field for the VEGF prefix, which is a part of the word vegetable.

So I'll specify a prefix as the query clause, and we'll use the text fields and more specifically, the keyword mapping.

And I'm going to simplify the syntax and specify the value to search for directly.

More specifically, the prefix I'll of v g and let's have a look at the results.

And if I scroll through them, we can see that the product tags include the term vegetable.

This term was, of course, matched because it begins with the prefix that we specified in the query.

Let's now continue our journey through the term level queries.
