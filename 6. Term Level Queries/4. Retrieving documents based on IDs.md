Similar to specifying an array of terms.

We can specify an array of IDs for the documents that we want to fetch by using a query named IDs.

This is useful if you want to fetch a number of documents whose IDs you already know.

That would be the case if you either store the IDs of documents within some kind of data store, such as a relational database, or if you just want to use the same identifiers in both places.

Let's try to fetch the documents with the IDs one, two and three.

So get products.

Defaults.

Search and query.

And then the ID query.

And a values parameter.

And I'll just enter one, two and three here within an array.

Within the results.

We now see the documents with the three IDs we specified.

So one, two and three.

Simple stuff, right?

That's all there is to it.
