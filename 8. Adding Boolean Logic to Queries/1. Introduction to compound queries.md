# Introduction to compound queries

In this section, we're going to look at how we can make use of Boolean logic when constructing search queries.

To do this will be using a group of queries referred to as compound queries.

Perhaps you remember the difference between compound queries and live queries from earlier in the course.

But if not, here's a quick recap.

Leave queries search for values within a given field and other queries that you have seen until now.

A leaf query is the most basic query and only performs one operation.

An example would be the term or match query.

Compound queries.

On the other hand, wrap leave queries or even other compound queries to construct more advanced queries.

The simplest example would be to wrap to leave queries with a Boolean query.

By doing this, we could build a query which matches documents that have the vegetable tag and are sold out, for example.

You'll see a number of examples in the following lectures, but the basic idea is to compound queries, act as wrappers for other queries they orchestrate leave queries.

Hopefully that makes sense.

Either way, we're going to get into it right now.
