## Introducing the Query DSL

Now that you saw the very basics of searching with the request UI, let's turn our attention to the query dstl.

The way we use to query Dstl is by specifying the search query within a JSON object instead of in the request uri.

This is similar to what we did when we added and updated documents, although the structure of the object is of course different.

There are two main groups of queries in the query DSL, live queries and compound queries.

The terminology is not so important to remember.

The basic idea is that live queries search for values within particular fields, whereas compound queries consists of multiple leaf queries or compound queries themselves.

Compound crews are therefore recursive in nature.

An example of a leaf query could be to search for documents with a category of fruit.

As you see on the diagram, an example of a compound query could be to wrap two leaf queries with a pull query and match documents with a category of fruit or vegetable.

As you can see, a number of leaf queries can be wrapped by a compound query.

We could make a more complex query by adding more leaf queries to the pull query, or we could even nest other compound queries within the bool query.

I'll get back to Boolean queries a bit later in the course, but this was just to give you an example of a compound query so that you can see the difference between those and leaf queries.

Enough talking.

Let's get to business and write our first search query using the query dstl.

## Matching all documents

```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
```
The request UI will be the same as when performing crude string searches, except there is no query parameters when searching with the query dstl.

So again, we'll use the jet HTTP verb and the index name and the type and the search API.

On the next line we'll add the query with an adjacent object and within a nested object named query.

Within this object is where we'll be defining the query.

The general structure for defining searches is to specify the name of the query as a key and the value of the query definition as the value.

So start out slow.

Let's use the simplest possible query to match all query.

It does exactly what its name implies matches all documents.

So like I said, as the key will enter the name of the query which will be match all in this case.

Now this particular query being matched all does need in configuration, but this is not the case for other query types, as you'll see soon.

So let's just go ahead and run the query.

And looking at the results, we can see that all 1000 documents have been matched by the query, which is, of course, what we expected.

But what do all of those fields within the search results mean anyways?

That's what we'll be looking at in the next lecture.

Now that we have written our first search query with the query DSL.
