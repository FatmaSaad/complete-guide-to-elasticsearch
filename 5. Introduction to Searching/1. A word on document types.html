<p>I need to steal your attention for a moment to talk about <em>mapping types</em>. These were a thing for older versions of Elasticsearch, but will be removed in version 8.x. They are already deprecated and are only available when actively opting into using them.&nbsp;However, this means that pretty much all endpoints for the Elasticsearch API has changed.&nbsp;Whenever you see <code>default</code> as part of an endpoint, this refers to the mapping type.</p><p>We have been using queries that are compatible with Elasticsearch 7.0.0 and later until now, but you are about to see some queries that use a type of <code>default</code>. The reason for that is that those lectures were recorded before <code>_doc</code> was a thing. Some APIs now use <code>_doc</code> instead of <code>default</code>, while others completely got rid of that part of the endpoint.&nbsp;For the queries that contain <code>default</code>, please check the <a href="https://github.com/codingexplained/complete-guide-to-elasticsearch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub repository for the updated queries</a>. The difference is just semantics, so hopefully it won't be an issue for you.</p><p>For instance, when you see the following:</p><p><code>GET&nbsp;/products/default/_search</code></p><p>... you should replace it with:</p><p><code>GET&nbsp;/products/_search</code></p><p>I am gradually updating the course with the latest queries, but please understand that re-recording and editing 10+ hours of content takes a long time, so there will be a period in which you will see the old document type being specified for parts of the course.&nbsp;This is a work in progress, and this document will be pushed forward as I&nbsp;make progress. ðŸ™‚&nbsp;If in doubt, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/codingexplained/complete-guide-to-elasticsearch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</p><p>Thank you for your understanding, and happy searching!</p>
