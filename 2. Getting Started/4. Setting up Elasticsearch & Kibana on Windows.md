00:00:02,641  -->  00:00:07,122
In this lecture I will show you how to set&nbsp;
up Elasticsearch and Kibana on Windows.

2

00:00:08,614  -->  00:00:12,880
Both Elasticsearch and Kibana are just&nbsp;
archives that need to be extracted,&nbsp;&nbsp;

3

00:00:12,880  -->  00:00:19,680
resulting in two directories on our file system.&nbsp;
That’s all — there are no applications to install,&nbsp;&nbsp;

4

00:00:19,680  -->  00:00:26,294
files in exotic directories, or anything like&nbsp;
that. Two self contained directories. Simple.

5

00:00:27,681  -->  00:00:33,382
Both Elasticsearch and Kibana have a couple&nbsp;
of dependencies, which are shipped within&nbsp;the archives.

6

00:00:34,081  -->  00:00:38,416
For example, Elasticsearch is&nbsp;
built with the Java programming language.&nbsp;&nbsp;

7

00:00:38,975  -->  00:00:42,400
Instead of requiring you to&nbsp;
install Java on your machine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

8

00:00:42,400  -->  00:00:46,455
Elasticsearch ships with OpenJDK&nbsp;
so you don’t have to do anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

9

00:00:47,188  -->  00:00:53,387
Likewise, Kibana uses Node.js for its web&nbsp;
server, which is also bundled within the archive.

10

00:00:54,988  -->  00:00:57,664
Alright, let’s get to business!

11

00:00:57,664  -->  00:01:02,775
The first thing you need to do is to download both&nbsp;
Elasticsearch and Kibana for your platform.

12

00:01:04,255  -->  00:01:08,255
I have attached the links to both download&nbsp;
pages to this lecture for your convenience.

13

00:01:09,775  -->  00:01:15,200
I have downloaded and extracted both archives&nbsp;
in advance. To extract the Kibana archive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

14

00:01:15,200  -->  00:01:19,294
you probably have to use something other&nbsp;
than the built-in Windows unzipper.&nbsp;&nbsp;

15

00:01:20,215  -->  00:01:25,015
Otherwise you might run into an issue&nbsp;
because one of the file paths is too long.&nbsp;&nbsp;

16

00:01:25,882  -->  00:01:31,440
I did encounter that issue and have seen&nbsp;
others run into it as well. To work around it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

17

00:01:31,440  -->  00:01:37,016
I unzipped the archive using 7-Zip, but most&nbsp;
other software should be able to handle this.

18

00:01:38,122  -->  00:01:41,920
When the archives have been extracted,&nbsp;
open up the Command Prompt and&nbsp;&nbsp;

19

00:01:41,920  -->  00:01:46,754
change your working directory to the&nbsp;
root of the Elasticsearch directory.&nbsp;&nbsp;

20

00:01:46,754  -->  00:01:50,428
Use the "cd" command for that, which&nbsp;
you are hopefully familiar with.

21

00:01:52,054  -->  00:01:58,277
Note that I renamed the extracted directories&nbsp;
because their names include the platform and&nbsp;&nbsp;version.

22

00:01:58,277  -->  00:02:02,402
Simply adjust the directory name to&nbsp;
match what it’s named on your file system.

23

00:02:04,110  -->  00:02:08,216
To start up Elasticsearch, we just&nbsp;
need to enter a super simple command.&nbsp;&nbsp;

24

00:02:09,334  -->  00:02:14,635
Simply type “bin\elasticsearch.bat.”&nbsp;&nbsp;

25

00:02:14,635  -->  00:02:18,962
This invokes a script named&nbsp;
“elasticsearch.bat” within the “bin” directory.

26

00:02:20,206  -->  00:02:27,400
That was easy, right? Elasticsearch is&nbsp;now 
starting up and performing various&nbsp;initialization tasks

27

00:02:27,400  -->  00:02:31,802
This may take a minute or&nbsp;
two, so I will just do a bit of time traveling.

28

00:02:33,975  -->  00:02:36,779
Alright, it’s the future me&nbsp;speaking. &nbsp;

29

00:02:36,779  -->  00:02:41,538
Elasticsearch has now fully started up and is ready for business.

30

00:02:41,538  -->  00:02:45,840
A couple of things were configured for&nbsp;
us automatically, one of which is various&nbsp;&nbsp;

31

00:02:45,840  -->  00:02:52,000
security measures. The first one is that&nbsp;
a superuser was created with a password,&nbsp;&nbsp;

32

00:02:52,000  -->  00:02:57,082
which you can see within the output. You&nbsp;
might have to scroll a bit to find it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

33

00:02:58,028  -->  00:03:03,440
Elasticsearch is secured with this user, so&nbsp;
anytime we communicate with Elasticsearch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

34

00:03:03,440  -->  00:03:08,320
we need to provide its credentials.&nbsp;
So go ahead and save the password,&nbsp;&nbsp;

35

00:03:08,320  -->  00:03:13,760
because you will need it a bit later. We&nbsp;
can create other users with more granular&nbsp;&nbsp;

36

00:03:13,760  -->  00:03:18,881
permissions for improved security, but let’s&nbsp;
go with the default security settings for now.

37

00:03:20,202  -->  00:03:23,920
If for some reason you lose the&nbsp;
password — or if you forget to&nbsp;&nbsp;

38

00:03:23,920  -->  00:03:27,629
save it — you can always reset&nbsp;
it with the following command.

39

00:03:29,814  -->  00:03:35,040
Apart from creating a superuser, TLS&nbsp;
certificates are also generated for both&nbsp;&nbsp;

40

00:03:35,040  -->  00:03:41,360
internal and external communication. This means&nbsp;
that data is encrypted when being transferred&nbsp;&nbsp;

41

00:03:41,360  -->  00:03:47,269
within Elasticsearch itself, and also when&nbsp;
we communicate with Elasticsearch over HTTP.&nbsp;&nbsp;

42

00:03:48,162  -->  00:03:52,508
This includes Kibana, which uses&nbsp;
Elasticsearch’s REST API under the hood.

43

00:03:53,946  -->  00:03:59,840
A so-called enrollment token is also created for&nbsp;
us, which we will need for setting up Kibana.&nbsp;&nbsp;

44

00:04:00,694  -->  00:04:05,200
This token is essentially a way of&nbsp;
ensuring that Kibana can communicate&nbsp;&nbsp;

45

00:04:05,200  -->  00:04:09,920
securely with Elasticsearch. The&nbsp;
token is valid for 30 minutes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

46

00:04:09,920  -->  00:04:13,840
but a new one can be created with&nbsp;
the following command if you need it.

47

00:04:15,440  -->  00:04:22,250
Alright, now that Elasticsearch is all set&nbsp;
up, let’s turn our attention to Kibana. 

48

00:04:22,250  -->  00:04:28,160
First, open up a new Command Prompt and set the 
working directory to the extracted Kibana directory.

49

00:04:29,775  -->  00:04:33,200
Starting up Kibana is as simple&nbsp;
as starting up Elasticsearch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

50

00:04:33,200  -->  00:04:39,393
so all we need to do is to type&nbsp;
in “bin\kibana.bat” and hit Enter.

51

00:04:42,134  -->  00:04:47,924
After a short moment, the Kibana&nbsp;
web server is ready on port&nbsp;&nbsp;5601.

52

00:04:47,924  -->  00:04:54,575
We need to do a bit of configuration,&nbsp;
so let’s open up the URL that is output.&nbsp;&nbsp;

53

00:04:54,575  -->  00:04:59,520
This URL includes a token for security&nbsp;
purposes, so that’s why we need to copy it.

54

00:05:04,415  -->  00:05:09,200
Kibana immediately prompts us to do some&nbsp;
configuration. All we really need to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

55

00:05:09,200  -->  00:05:14,080
is to paste in the enrollment token that&nbsp;
was output when starting up Elasticsearch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

56

00:05:14,080  -->  00:05:16,401
so let’s head back to the&nbsp;
Command Prompt to grab it.

57

00:05:21,708  -->  00:05:27,440
This token contains various information that&nbsp;
Kibana needs to connect securely to Elasticsearch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

58

00:05:27,440  -->  00:05:30,000
meaning that we don’t have&nbsp;
to configure things manually.

59

00:05:31,215  -->  00:05:34,601
So we just need to paste in&nbsp;
the token and hit the button.

60

00:05:47,655  -->  00:05:50,807
Alright, Kibana is now done setting things up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

61

00:05:50,807  -->  00:05:56,274
As part of this process, it wrote a couple&nbsp;
of things to its configuration file for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;

62

00:05:56,274  -->  00:06:01,522
That makes our lives much easier, and our&nbsp;
Elastic Stack deployment more secure. Good stuff!

63

00:06:02,815  -->  00:06:07,288
Since our deployment is secured,&nbsp;
we need to authenticate to proceed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

64

00:06:07,288  -->  00:06:12,415
We just set things up, so we only have&nbsp;
one user, namely the “elastic” superuser.

65

00:06:14,082  -->  00:06:18,160
A password was generated automatically&nbsp;
when we started up Elasticsearch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

66

00:06:18,160  -->  00:06:21,000
so let’s head back to the&nbsp;
Command Prompt to copy it.

67

00:06:37,535  -->  00:06:43,675
Alright, we’re in! That’s all it takes&nbsp;
to set up both Elasticsearch and Kibana.

68

00:06:43,675  -->  00:06:47,526
If you want to shut down Elasticsearch&nbsp;
and Kibana at some point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

69

00:06:47,526  -->  00:06:53,849
simply press the CTRL and C keys simultaneously&nbsp;
within the respective Command Prompt windows.

70

00:06:53,849  -->  00:06:58,720
Anyway, we are now ready to get started,&nbsp;
so I’ll see you in the next lecture.
