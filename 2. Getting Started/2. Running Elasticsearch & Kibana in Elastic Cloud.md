00:00:02,731  -->  00:00:10,350
Let’s begin by seeing how to set up Elasticsearch
and Kibana on Elastic Cloud, which is the easiest approach.

2

00:00:10,350  -->  00:00:16,049
Elastic Cloud is a hosted and managed solution
for those who want to easily deploy an Elasticsearch

3

00:00:16,049  -->  00:00:20,681
cluster and avoid managing the underlying
infrastructure.

4

00:00:20,681  -->  00:00:23,042
I have the sign up page opened up.

5

00:00:23,042  -->  00:00:26,189
You can find the link attached to this lecture.

6

00:00:26,189  -->  00:00:29,320
All we need to do is to enter our email address.

7

00:00:32,335  -->  00:00:37,143
The trial is free, and no credit card information
is required.

8

00:00:37,143  -->  00:00:44,566
After the 14 days, your deployment will automatically
be shut down, and you will not be charged anything.

9

00:00:44,566  -->  00:00:48,699
The trial should be sufficient for you to
mess around with Kibana while you work your

10

00:00:48,699  -->  00:00:50,681
way through this course.

11

00:00:50,681  -->  00:00:54,282
Anyway, let’s click the button to register
for the trial.

12

00:00:56,181  -->  00:01:01,546
Once that’s done, you will get an email
asking you to verify your email address.

13

00:01:02,688  -->  00:01:07,220
Clicking the link within that email will lead
you to this page where we should enter the

14

00:01:07,220  -->  00:01:09,910
password for our account.

15

00:01:09,910  -->  00:01:15,210
The validation rules for the password are
pretty strict to be honest, which can be a

16

00:01:15,210  -->  00:01:20,015
bit annoying — especially if you are not
using a password manager.

17

00:01:20,015  -->  00:01:23,804
Anyway, I will just paste in a password that
passes the validation.

18

00:01:25,125  -->  00:01:30,562
Clicking the button will set the password
and take us to the Elastic Cloud console.

19

00:01:32,004  -->  00:01:38,805
Note that your trial hasn’t started yet;
the 14 days only begin when you create a deployment.

20

00:01:38,805  -->  00:01:41,515
Let’s do that now by clicking this button.

21

00:01:42,740  -->  00:01:48,598
The first thing we need to do when creating
a deployment is to choose a pre-configured solution.

22

00:01:48,598  -->  00:01:55,209
These are essentially templates that use different
hardware configurations based on our use case.

23

00:01:55,209  -->  00:02:01,127
In our case, we should choose the “Elastic
Stack” solution, which is an all-purpose solution.

24

00:02:04,334  -->  00:02:07,372
Next, we can choose a hardware profile.

25

00:02:07,372  -->  00:02:13,060
Some of these are also intended for specific
use cases, so let’s just go with the default

26

00:02:13,060  -->  00:02:16,194
one, again being an all-purpose solution.

27

00:02:19,354  -->  00:02:22,862
Next, we have a couple of deployment settings.

28

00:02:22,862  -->  00:02:28,190
Elastic Cloud deployments are hosted on a
cloud provider of our choice.

29

00:02:28,190  -->  00:02:34,400
This is all managed on our behalf, so we don’t
need an account for any of the providers.

30

00:02:34,400  -->  00:02:38,870
We can then choose the region in which we
want our deployment to be created.

31

00:02:38,870  -->  00:02:45,161
For the purpose of this course, I will just leave
the cloud provider and region at the default values.

32

00:02:45,161  -->  00:02:50,350
Lastly, we can choose which version of the
Elastic Stack that we want to deploy.

33

00:02:50,350  -->  00:02:57,000
The most recent release is chosen by default,
which is also the one you should go with.

34

00:02:57,000  -->  00:03:01,620
There are a couple of more options, none of
which are relevant to us, so let’s give

35

00:03:01,620  -->  00:03:04,060
our deployment a name and create it.

36

00:03:04,060  -->  00:03:06,841
It doesn’t really matter what you type here.

37

00:03:19,444  -->  00:03:25,205
Our deployment is now being created in the
background, which is going to take a few minutes.

38

00:03:25,205  -->  00:03:30,563
We are presented with the credentials for
our Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana instance.

39

00:03:30,563  -->  00:03:33,740
We will need these, so be sure to save them.

40

00:03:33,740  -->  00:03:37,730
The username is always “elastic” and cannot
be changed.

41

00:03:37,730  -->  00:03:43,351
If you lose the password somehow, you are
able to reset it within the Elastic Cloud console.

42

00:03:43,351  -->  00:03:46,069
I will just grab a copy of the password myself.

43

00:03:47,691  -->  00:03:51,931
The “Download” button will just save the
credentials as a CSV file.

44

00:03:54,671  -->  00:03:59,398
Anyway, the deployment is still being created,
so I will be back when it’s done.

45

00:04:01,621  -->  00:04:07,790
Alright, our deployment has now been created,
and both Elasticsearch and Kibana are ready for use!

46

00:04:07,790  -->  00:04:13,301
On this page, we can manage our deployment
as well as find more details about it.

47

00:04:13,301  -->  00:04:19,040
At the bottom, for instance, we can see which
instances were started up for the deployment.

48

00:04:19,040  -->  00:04:21,347
We won’t go into detail with that.

49

00:04:23,630  -->  00:04:30,420
The page also includes the endpoints to Elasticsearch
and Kibana, both of which we will need in this course.

50

00:04:30,420  -->  00:04:35,070
In a couple of lectures you will need the
Elasticsearch endpoint, so this is where you

51

00:04:35,070  -->  00:04:37,302
can go to grab it.

52

00:04:37,302  -->  00:04:39,910
This is also where we launch Kibana.

53

00:04:39,910  -->  00:04:44,820
You can copy the endpoint for Kibana as well,
but you will need to provide the password

54

00:04:44,820  -->  00:04:51,655
for the “elastic” user — being the credentials
that popped up when we created the deployment.

55

00:04:51,655  -->  00:04:55,485
Clicking the “Launch” link will automatically
sign us in.

56

00:04:55,485  -->  00:04:58,896
That’s slightly more convenient, so let’s
do that.

57

00:05:05,892  -->  00:05:10,620
Since we don’t have any data within our
Elasticsearch cluster, we are presented with

58

00:05:10,620  -->  00:05:13,212
this dialog when loading Kibana.

59

00:05:13,212  -->  00:05:18,630
Basically we have the choice of importing
some test data provided by Elastic, or continuing

60

00:05:18,630  -->  00:05:20,708
without any data.

61

00:05:20,708  -->  00:05:25,304
Since we will import our own test data soon,
let’s go with the latter and click the

62

00:05:25,304  -->  00:05:28,590
“Explore on my own” link.

63

00:05:28,590  -->  00:05:31,722
And there we go, everything is now ready.

64

00:05:31,722  -->  00:05:33,706
That was pretty easy, right?

65

00:05:33,706  -->  00:05:35,561
I’ll see you in the next lecture.
