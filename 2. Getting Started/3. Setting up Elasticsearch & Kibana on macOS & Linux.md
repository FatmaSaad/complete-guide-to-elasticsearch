00:00:02,580  -->  00:00:08,430
In this lecture I will show you how to set
up Elasticsearch and Kibana on macOS and Linux.

2

00:00:08,430  -->  00:00:12,595
If you are using Windows, please continue
to the next lecture.

3

00:00:12,595  -->  00:00:17,720
Both Elasticsearch and Kibana are just archives
that need to be extracted, resulting in two

4

00:00:17,720  -->  00:00:20,646
directories on our file system.

5

00:00:20,646  -->  00:00:25,990
That’s all — there are no applications
to install, files in exotic directories, or

6

00:00:25,990  -->  00:00:27,773
anything like that.

7

00:00:27,773  -->  00:00:30,749
Two self contained directories. Simple.

8

00:00:31,621  -->  00:00:36,400
Both Elasticsearch and Kibana have a couple
of dependencies, which are shipped within

9

00:00:36,400  -->  00:00:38,120
the archives.

10

00:00:38,120  -->  00:00:42,995
For example, Elasticsearch is built with the
Java programming language.

11

00:00:42,995  -->  00:00:48,930
Instead of requiring you to install Java on
your machine, Elasticsearch ships with OpenJDK

12

00:00:48,930  -->  00:00:51,164
so you don’t have to do anything.

13

00:00:51,164  -->  00:00:57,830
Likewise, Kibana uses Node.js for its web
server, which is also bundled within the archive.

14

00:00:58,941  -->  00:01:01,680
Alright, let’s get to business!

15

00:01:01,680  -->  00:01:07,591
The first thing you need to do is to download
both Elasticsearch and Kibana for your platform.

16

00:01:08,260  -->  00:01:14,631
Choose “aarch64” if you are on an ARM
based CPU or “x86” otherwise.

17

00:01:14,631  -->  00:01:19,970
I have attached the links to both download
pages to this lecture for your convenience.

18

00:01:19,970  -->  00:01:23,910
I have downloaded and extracted both archives
in advance.

19

00:01:23,910  -->  00:01:28,350
To extract the archives, simply double clicking
them should do the trick.

20

00:01:28,350  -->  00:01:31,229
Alternatively you can use the following commands.

21

00:01:32,540  -->  00:01:37,530
When the archives have been extracted, open
a Terminal and change your working directory

22

00:01:37,530  -->  00:01:40,776
to the root of the Elasticsearch directory.

23

00:01:40,776  -->  00:01:45,272
Use the "cd" command for that, which you are
hopefully familiar with.

24

00:01:48,849  -->  00:01:55,069
Note that I renamed the extracted directories
because their names include the platform and version.

25

00:01:55,069  -->  00:02:00,310
Simply adjust the directory name to match
what it’s named on your file system.

26

00:02:00,310  -->  00:02:05,484
To start up Elasticsearch, we just need to
enter a super simple command.

27

00:02:05,484  -->  00:02:12,185
Simply type bin/elasticsearch. 

28

00:02:12,185  -->  00:02:17,405
This invokes a script named “elasticsearch”
within the “bin” directory.

29

00:02:17,405  -->  00:02:19,339
That was easy, right?

30

00:02:19,339  -->  00:02:24,632
Elasticsearch is now starting up and performing
various initialization tasks.

31

00:02:24,632  -->  00:02:29,533
This may take a minute or two, so I will just
do a bit of time traveling.

32

00:02:31,570  -->  00:02:34,358
Alright, it’s the future me speaking.

33

00:02:34,358  -->  00:02:39,121
Elasticsearch has now fully started up and
is ready for business.

34

00:02:39,121  -->  00:02:45,840
A couple of things were configured for us
automatically, one of which is various security measures.

35

00:02:45,840  -->  00:02:50,849
The first one is that a superuser was created
with a password, which you can see within

36

00:02:50,849  -->  00:02:52,680
the terminal output.

37

00:02:52,680  -->  00:02:55,629
You might have to scroll a bit to find it.

38

00:02:55,629  -->  00:03:01,370
Elasticsearch is secured with this user, so
anytime we communicate with Elasticsearch,

39

00:03:01,370  -->  00:03:04,278
we need to provide its credentials.

40

00:03:04,278  -->  00:03:09,000
So go ahead and save the password, because
you will need it a bit later.

41

00:03:09,000  -->  00:03:14,069
We can create other users with more granular
permissions for improved security, but let’s

42

00:03:14,069  -->  00:03:17,793
go with the default security settings for
now.

43

00:03:17,793  -->  00:03:23,190
If for some reason you lose the password — or
if you forget to save it — you can always

44

00:03:23,190  -->  00:03:25,671
reset it with the following command.

45

00:03:27,053  -->  00:03:33,900
Apart from creating a superuser, TLS certificates
are also generated for both internal and external

46

00:03:33,900  -->  00:03:35,542
communication.

47

00:03:35,542  -->  00:03:41,010
This means that data is encrypted when being
transferred within Elasticsearch itself, and

48

00:03:41,010  -->  00:03:45,358
also when we communicate with Elasticsearch
over HTTP.

49

00:03:45,358  -->  00:03:51,161
This includes Kibana, which uses Elasticsearch’s
REST API under the hood.

50

00:03:51,161  -->  00:03:57,903
A so-called enrollment token is also created
for us, which we will need for setting up Kibana.

51

00:03:57,903  -->  00:04:05,080
This token is essentially a way of ensuring that 
Kibana can communicate securely with Elasticsearch.

52

00:04:05,080  -->  00:04:10,170
The token is valid for 30 minutes, but a new
one can be created with the following command

53

00:04:10,170  -->  00:04:12,377
if you need it.

54

00:04:12,377  -->  00:04:18,859
Alright, now that Elasticsearch is all set
up, let’s turn our attention to Kibana.

55

00:04:18,859  -->  00:04:26,471
First, open up a new terminal window and set the
working directory to the extracted Kibana directory

56

00:04:26,471  -->  00:04:30,718
Before starting up Kibana, we need to take
care of one thing.

57

00:04:30,718  -->  00:04:36,871
This is a macOS specific thing, so if you
are using Linux, simply skip this step.

58

00:04:36,871  -->  00:04:43,990
macOS has a security mechanism called Gatekeeper,
which enforces code signing and verifies downloaded

59

00:04:43,990  -->  00:04:47,386
applications before allowing them to run.

60

00:04:47,386  -->  00:04:52,680
This affects Kibana’s ability to run on
macOS, so we need to disable Gatekeeper for

61

00:04:52,680  -->  00:04:55,069
the Kibana directory.

62

00:04:55,069  -->  00:05:00,249
To do that, we need to go to the parent directory
and run a command.

63

00:05:00,249  -->  00:05:02,169
I will just type in the command.

64

00:05:02,169  -->  00:05:06,085
You can find it within the GitHub repository
if you want to copy it.

65

00:05:11,750  -->  00:05:18,123
The last argument is the name of the Kibana
directory, so be sure to change that if needed.

66

00:05:18,123  -->  00:05:19,841
Alright, that’s that.

67

00:05:19,841  -->  00:05:24,839
Let’s go back to the Kibana directory and
start up Kibana.

68

00:05:24,839  -->  00:05:29,124
To do that, simply type in bin/kibana and
hit Enter.

69

00:05:32,615  -->  00:05:38,419
After a short moment, the Kibana web server
is ready on port 5601.

70

00:05:38,419  -->  00:05:45,000
We need to do a bit of configuration, so let’s
open up the URL that is output within the terminal.

71

00:05:45,000  -->  00:05:50,857
This URL includes a token for security purposes,
so that’s why we need to copy it.

72

00:05:57,240  -->  00:06:01,109
Kibana immediately prompts us to do some configuration.

73

00:06:01,109  -->  00:06:05,439
All we really need to do is to paste in the
enrollment token that was output when starting

74

00:06:05,439  -->  00:06:09,584
up Elasticsearch, so let’s head back to
the terminal to grab it.

75

00:06:16,081  -->  00:06:22,049
This token contains various information that
Kibana needs to connect securely to Elasticsearch,

76

00:06:22,049  -->  00:06:26,079
meaning that we don’t have to configure
things manually.

77

00:06:26,079  -->  00:06:29,867
So we just need to paste in the token and
hit the button.

78

00:06:42,192  -->  00:06:45,240
Alright, Kibana is now done setting things
up.

79

00:06:45,240  -->  00:06:50,789
As part of this process, it wrote a couple
of things to its configuration file for us.

80

00:06:50,789  -->  00:06:55,420
That makes our lives much easier, and our
Elastic Stack deployment more secure.

81

00:06:55,420  -->  00:06:56,353
Good stuff!

82

00:06:57,293  -->  00:07:01,800
Since our deployment is secured, we need to
authenticate to proceed.

83

00:07:01,800  -->  00:07:07,224
We just set things up, so we only have one
user, namely the “elastic” superuser.

84

00:07:09,732  -->  00:07:14,699
A password was generated automatically when
we started up Elasticsearch, so let’s head

85

00:07:14,699  -->  00:07:16,922
back to the terminal to copy it.

86

00:07:28,848  -->  00:07:30,865
Alright, we’re in!

87

00:07:30,865  -->  00:07:35,009
That’s all it takes to set up both Elasticsearch
and Kibana.

88

00:07:35,009  -->  00:07:40,319
If you want to shut down Elasticsearch and
Kibana at some point, simply press the CTRL

89

00:07:40,319  -->  00:07:45,093
and C keys simultaneously within the respective
terminal windows.

90

00:07:45,093  -->  00:07:49,436
Anyway, we are now ready to get started, so
I’ll see you in the next lecture.
