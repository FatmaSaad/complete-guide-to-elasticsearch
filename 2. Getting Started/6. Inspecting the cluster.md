1

00:00:02,580  -->  00:00:07,720
Alright, now that you know the very basics
of what an Elasticsearch cluster looks like,

2

00:00:07,720  -->  00:00:11,894
let’s take a moment to inspect the one that
we have running.

3

00:00:11,894  -->  00:00:16,044
To do that, let’s open up the Console tool
in Kibana.

4

00:00:16,044  -->  00:00:20,729
You can find it by expanding the menu and
clicking the “Dev Tools” menu item,

5

00:00:20,729  -->  00:00:23,759
located within the “Management” group.

6

00:00:23,759  -->  00:00:28,170
This is the first time that we will send a
request to Elasticsearch.

7

00:00:28,170  -->  00:00:34,120
As you might remember, an Elasticsearch cluster
exposes a REST API, which is what we will

8

00:00:34,120  -->  00:00:36,520
be communicating with.

9

00:00:36,520  -->  00:00:43,270
Essentially this means that the HTTP verbs differ 
differ depending on the actions that we want to perform.

10

00:00:43,270  -->  00:00:49,260
By HTTP verbs, I am referring to GET, POST,
PUT, and DELETE.

11

00:00:49,260  -->  00:00:54,960
Although we will be typing in our query within
Kibana’s Console tool, Kibana still uses

12

00:00:54,960  -->  00:00:57,360
the REST API under the hood.

13

00:00:57,360  -->  00:01:02,647
On the Elasticsearch end of things, an HTTP
request is received.

14

00:01:02,647  -->  00:01:07,294
This request is treated the same, regardless
of where it was sent from.

15

00:01:07,294  -->  00:01:14,210
As long as the request is valid, we can access
the REST API from any HTTP client of our choice,

16

00:01:14,210  -->  00:01:16,660
such as cURL, Postman, etc.

17

00:01:17,760  -->  00:01:23,261
You will see an example of this in the next
lecture, but for now, let’s use the Console tool.

18

00:01:24,530  -->  00:01:30,240
The format in which we need to enter queries
within the Console tool, is to start by specifying

19

00:01:30,240  -->  00:01:32,000
the HTTP verb.

20

00:01:32,578  -->  00:01:37,281
Let’s begin by retrieving information about
our cluster’s health.

21

00:01:37,281  -->  00:01:40,945
Since we’ll be retrieving data, we will
use the “GET” verb.

22

00:01:42,200  -->  00:01:49,510
Next, we need to specify the request path, being 
the part following the cluster’s network address.

23

00:01:49,510  -->  00:01:54,610
When using the Console tool, we should not
specify the network address, since this is

24

00:01:54,610  -->  00:01:59,940
specified within Kibana’s configuration
file, and will automatically be prepended

25

00:01:59,940  -->  00:02:01,750
to the HTTP request.

26

00:02:02,864  -->  00:02:07,168
To retrieve the cluster’s health, we use
the following request path.

27

00:02:11,820  -->  00:02:16,900
As the first thing, I want to mention that
the leading forward slash is optional when

28

00:02:16,900  -->  00:02:22,770
using the Console tool; if you leave it out,
Kibana will automatically add it before sending

29

00:02:22,770  -->  00:02:24,760
the HTTP request.

30

00:02:24,760  -->  00:02:31,137
So whether or not you include it is up to how 
explicit you want to be when writing your requests.

31

00:02:31,137  -->  00:02:34,825
I like to include it, but that doesn’t mean
that you have to.

32

00:02:36,164  -->  00:02:41,920
Alright, so let’s briefly talk about the
request path that we specified.

33

00:02:41,920  -->  00:02:50,123
The _cluster part specifies the API that we want to 
access, whereas the health part specifies the command.

34

00:02:51,250  -->  00:02:55,110
APIs begin with an underscore by convention.

35

00:02:55,110  -->  00:02:59,819
In place of "health," there are a number of
other commands that can be used to retrieve

36

00:02:59,819  -->  00:03:03,965
detailed information about the cluster and
its nodes.

37

00:03:03,965  -->  00:03:09,840
These commands yield results that are a bit
too advanced to get into right now, so let’s

38

00:03:09,840  -->  00:03:12,565
stick to the "health" command and run the query.

39

00:03:15,891  -->  00:03:21,060
On the right-hand side of the screen, we can
see the results of the query, being a JSON

40

00:03:21,060  -->  00:03:24,900
object containing information about the cluster.

41

00:03:24,900  -->  00:03:30,430
The cluster’s name is set to “elasticsearch,”
which is the default value.

42

00:03:30,430  -->  00:03:35,930
You can configure this to a more meaningful
name, within the elasticsearch.yml configuration

43

00:03:35,930  -->  00:03:38,720
file if you want to.

44

00:03:38,720  -->  00:03:42,890
We can also see that the status of the cluster
is set to “green.”

45

00:03:42,890  -->  00:03:48,080
You probably won’t be surprised that this
means that everything is okay and that the

46

00:03:48,080  -->  00:03:50,300
cluster is in a healthy state.

47

00:03:51,146  -->  00:03:56,209
We will revisit the cluster’s health status
in a couple of lectures, where you will see

48

00:03:56,209  -->  00:04:00,175
a situation in which the status is no longer
“green.”

49

00:04:01,387  -->  00:04:07,391
Let’s continue exploring the cluster, this
time listing the nodes that are part of it.

50

00:04:07,391  -->  00:04:13,066
For that, there is a CAT API, which outputs
data into a human readable format.

51

00:04:14,166  -->  00:04:19,751
Within the CAT API, there is a command named
"nodes" which does what we are looking for.

52

00:04:21,217  -->  00:04:26,983
I added a query parameter named “v,” which
adds a descriptive header row to the output.

53

00:04:26,983  -->  00:04:28,292
Let’s run the query.

54

00:04:31,210  -->  00:04:36,300
The results show some basic information about
the single node that we have running, including

55

00:04:36,300  -->  00:04:41,505
its IP address, name, as well as some performance
measures.

56

00:04:41,505  -->  00:04:46,469
If you are using a cloud deployment, you will
see multiple nodes here unless your deployment

57

00:04:46,469  -->  00:04:48,961
is not using default settings.

58

00:04:48,961  -->  00:04:54,241
That’s because cloud deployments are configured
for high availability by default, meaning

59

00:04:54,241  -->  00:04:59,399
that at least two nodes are running in different
availability zones.

60

00:04:59,399  -->  00:05:06,039
In Elasticsearch, a node has a number of roles
associated with it, specifying its responsibilities

61

00:05:06,039  -->  00:05:08,279
within the cluster.

62

00:05:08,279  -->  00:05:11,770
We can also see that the node is a so-called
master node.

63

00:05:12,658  -->  00:05:17,650
I will get back to both of these things in a couple 
of lectures, so don’t worry about it for now.

64

00:05:19,370  -->  00:05:24,939
By specifying query parameters, we can retrieve
much more information about our nodes than

65

00:05:24,939  -->  00:05:27,149
what you see here.

66

00:05:27,149  -->  00:05:35,330
There is also a Nodes API that returns information
about the cluster’s nodes in almost excruciating detail.

67

00:05:35,330  -->  00:05:39,729
I will leave you to explore both of these
options if you are curious.

68

00:05:39,729  -->  00:05:43,374
You can find links to the documentation attached
to this lecture.

69

00:05:45,080  -->  00:05:50,289
As the last thing for this lecture, let’s
check which indices we have within our cluster

70

00:05:50,289  -->  00:05:53,196
by using the CAT API’s "indices" command.

71

00:05:59,159  -->  00:06:03,490
We get no indices back since we haven’t
added any yet.

72

00:06:03,490  -->  00:06:07,144
That’s probably what you expected to happen.

73

00:06:07,144  -->  00:06:11,670
That doesn’t mean that our cluster doesn’t
contain any indices, though.

74

00:06:11,670  -->  00:06:15,553
Let me just add a query parameter and show
you what I mean.

75

00:06:24,363  -->  00:06:27,555
Now we do see a number of indices.

76

00:06:27,555  -->  00:06:33,909
These indices are so-called system indices,
which are indices that are used by both Elasticsearch

77

00:06:33,909  -->  00:06:37,489
and Kibana to store various things.

78

00:06:37,489  -->  00:06:43,844
For instance, Kibana stores its configuration
such as dashboards within one of these indices.

79

00:06:44,803  -->  00:06:49,222
That’s because Kibana doesn’t ship with
a database of any kind.

80

00:06:49,222  -->  00:06:55,449
This means that if you set up a fresh instance
of Kibana and point it to an existing Elasticsearch

81

00:06:55,449  -->  00:06:59,548
cluster, all of the existing Kibana data will
be loaded.

82

00:07:00,929  -->  00:07:06,540
The leading period within an index name indicates
that the index is a system index, 

83

00:07:06,540  -->  00:07:08,967
meaning that it will be hidden by default.

84

00:07:09,940  -->  00:07:14,629
This is similar to hidden files and directories
on Linux and macOS.

85

00:07:15,390  -->  00:07:20,969
That’s why we had to add the "expand_wildcards"
query parameter to see these system indices.

86

00:07:22,379  -->  00:07:26,453
Alright, that’s all I wanted to show you
in this lecture.

87

00:07:26,453  -->  00:07:31,899
We’ve run our first query against our Elasticsearch
cluster, and we’ve taken a quick look at

88

00:07:31,899  -->  00:07:34,581
what it looks like internally.

89

00:07:34,581  -->  00:07:38,899
We’ll get into more detail in the following
lectures, so I’ll see you there!
