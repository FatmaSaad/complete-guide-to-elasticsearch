1

00:00:02,580  -->  00:00:06,889
You have just seen how to run queries using
Kibana’s Console tool.

2

00:00:06,889  -->  00:00:12,097
That’s the easiest way of running queries,
because it helps us in a number of ways.

3

00:00:12,097  -->  00:00:17,060
It formats the response so that it is easy
to read, and it handles some things for us

4

00:00:17,060  -->  00:00:21,117
under the hood, such as setting the correct
Content-Type header.

5

00:00:21,117  -->  00:00:26,954
Apart from that, it also provides auto-completion
when typing our queries.

6

00:00:26,954  -->  00:00:32,119
This is very convenient, because sometimes
it can be hard to remember all of the different

7

00:00:32,119  -->  00:00:34,450
queries that Elasticsearch provides.

8

00:00:35,547  -->  00:00:40,220
These are the reasons why we will be using
the Console tool throughout the course, but

9

00:00:40,220  -->  00:00:46,023
I do want to show you how to run queries with
cURL as well, just in case you prefer to do that.

10

00:00:47,160  -->  00:00:52,081
You can use other HTTP clients as well, such
as Postman.

11

00:00:52,081  -->  00:00:58,726
You should already have cURL installed with the 
exception being for some old versions of Windows

12

00:00:58,726  -->  00:01:02,120
I have attached a download link to this lecture
in case you need it.

13

00:01:03,217  -->  00:01:09,070
Anyway, let’s type out the simplest possible
cURL command by simply specifying the endpoint

14

00:01:09,070  -->  00:01:11,077
of our Elasticsearch cluster.

15

00:01:16,723  -->  00:01:22,030
If you are using Elastic Cloud, be sure to
use the Elasticsearch endpoint from the deployment

16

00:01:22,030  -->  00:01:24,577
page and not the Kibana endpoint.

17

00:01:25,776  -->  00:01:32,350
The GET HTTP verb is implicitly assumed if
none is specific, but we can also specify

18

00:01:32,350  -->  00:01:35,124
it with the -X argument as follows.

19

00:01:40,068  -->  00:01:41,990
Let’s send the request.

20

00:01:43,145  -->  00:01:47,872
As you can see, we get an empty response back
from Elasticsearch.

21

00:01:47,872  -->  00:01:52,950
That’s because from version 8 and onwards,
we need to use the TLS endpoint instead of

22

00:01:52,950  -->  00:01:55,775
plaintext, so let’s change that.

23

00:02:00,763  -->  00:02:03,440
Now we get a certificate error.

24

00:02:03,440  -->  00:02:08,760
The reason is that Elasticsearch generates
a self signed certificate by default, which

25

00:02:08,760  -->  00:02:13,715
is not trusted by HTTP clients for security
reasons.

26

00:02:13,715  -->  00:02:19,091
Note that this only applies to local setups,
so if you created a cloud deployment, you

27

00:02:19,091  -->  00:02:20,830
will not face this issue.

28

00:02:21,737  -->  00:02:27,746
The easiest way to get around that is to simply
use cURL’s --insecure flag as follows.

29

00:02:34,065  -->  00:02:39,950
This flag instructs cURL to ignore the certificate
error, and if you look closely, you can see

30

00:02:39,950  -->  00:02:41,776
that we now get a different error.

31

00:02:43,224  -->  00:02:49,380
This was an easy solution and it works just
fine for local development, but the more correct

32

00:02:49,380  -->  00:02:55,712
approach is to provide cURL with the CA certificate
with the "cacert" argument.

33

00:02:55,712  -->  00:02:57,254
Let me just type that out.

34

00:03:10,988  -->  00:03:17,380
The CA certificate is located within the config/certs
directory as you can see.

35

00:03:17,380  -->  00:03:22,680
If your working directory is the Elasticsearch
root directory, you can specify the relative

36

00:03:22,680  -->  00:03:25,253
path just like I did.

37

00:03:25,253  -->  00:03:28,130
Otherwise you can use an absolute path as well.

38

00:03:29,490  -->  00:03:34,680
Running the command, you can see that the
certificate error went away with this approach as well.

39

00:03:36,050  -->  00:03:38,650
Alright, so far so good.

40

00:03:38,650  -->  00:03:44,448
We still get an error, because we need to
authenticate with our Elasticsearch cluster.

41

00:03:44,448  -->  00:03:49,660
This also applies if you have created a cloud
deployment instead of a local one.

42

00:03:49,660  -->  00:03:53,719
Doing so is simple with cURL’s -u argument.

43

00:03:53,719  -->  00:03:57,104
The value should simply be the username for
your deployment.

44

00:04:03,569  -->  00:04:08,510
For local deployments, the password is the
one that was generated the first time Elasticsearch

45

00:04:08,510  -->  00:04:10,446
started up.

46

00:04:10,446  -->  00:04:14,623
When running the command, cURL will prompt
us to enter our password.

47

00:04:18,806  -->  00:04:21,699
Perfect, that worked as intended.

48

00:04:21,699  -->  00:04:26,992
For the endpoint we defined, Elasticsearch
returns basic information about our cluster.

49

00:04:28,148  -->  00:04:33,831
As an alternative, you can supply your password
for the -u argument as well.

50

00:04:33,831  -->  00:04:37,678
Simply add a colon after the username followed
by the password.

51

00:04:43,207  -->  00:04:48,017
With this approach, cURL will not prompt us
to enter the password when running the command.

52

00:04:49,260  -->  00:04:54,620
The password will, however, be exposed within
your terminal, so this is not ideal from a

53

00:04:54,620  -->  00:04:59,797
security perspective - especially when communicating
with a production cluster.

54

00:05:00,719  -->  00:05:04,864
Anyway, that was the most basic request we
could send.

55

00:05:04,864  -->  00:05:11,553
Oftentimes we need to send some data along
with our request, such as when searching for data.

56

00:05:11,553  -->  00:05:17,686
Let’s update our request path to use Elasticsearch’s
Search API for a products index.

57

00:05:17,686  -->  00:05:21,291
This index doesn’t exist yet, but we will
create it later.

58

00:05:25,591  -->  00:05:31,992
The Search API requires us to send a JSON
object specifying constraints for our query.

59

00:05:31,992  -->  00:05:37,349
We will get back to searching for data later,
so I will just use the simplest possible query

60

00:05:37,349  -->  00:05:40,210
which matches all documents.

61

00:05:40,210  -->  00:05:44,580
To specify the data, we can use cURL’s -d
argument.

62

00:05:44,580  -->  00:05:45,961
Let me just type it out.

63

00:05:59,257  -->  00:06:00,280
Alright.

64

00:06:00,280  -->  00:06:04,852
Don’t worry about the JSON object, but here
is a formatted version of it anyway.

65

00:06:05,730  -->  00:06:10,740
Notice how I enclosed it within single quotes
to avoid having to escape all of the double

66

00:06:10,740  -->  00:06:13,303
quotes with backslashes.

67

00:06:13,303  -->  00:06:18,552
That approach doesn’t work on Windows because
it doesn’t like single quotes.

68

00:06:18,552  -->  00:06:23,550
Instead, you need to wrap the argument within
double quotes and then escape each double

69

00:06:23,550  -->  00:06:26,249
quote within the JSON object.

70

00:06:26,249  -->  00:06:31,210
You can see an example on your screen, and
you can copy it from within the GitHub repository

71

00:06:31,210  -->  00:06:33,562
to save some typing.

72

00:06:33,562  -->  00:06:36,646
Anyway, let’s hit Enter and see what we get.

73

00:06:38,050  -->  00:06:43,837
We get an error back saying that the provided
Content-Type header is not supported.

74

00:06:43,837  -->  00:06:50,725
When adding data with the -d argument, cURL
just assumes that we are mimicking a form submission.

75

00:06:50,725  -->  00:06:56,199
Because Elasticsearch expects to receive JSON,
we need to explicitly define which kind of

76

00:06:56,199  -->  00:06:58,345
data we are sending.

77

00:06:58,345  -->  00:07:04,430
That’s done by specifying a Content-Type
header with a value of application/json.

78

00:07:04,430  -->  00:07:07,860
That can be done with the -H argument as follows.

79

00:07:25,000  -->  00:07:28,559
That should fix the error, so let’s send
the request again.

80

00:07:30,168  -->  00:07:32,479
Indeed the header error went away.

81

00:07:32,479  -->  00:07:37,422
We now get a different error stating that
the products index doesn’t exist.

82

00:07:37,422  -->  00:07:42,186
That’s to be expected since we haven’t
created it yet, so everything is good.

83

00:07:43,210  -->  00:07:47,436
So that’s how to send requests to Elasticsearch
with cURL.

84

00:07:47,436  -->  00:07:53,149
If you encounter any problems, try checking
the order of the arguments, as cURL is quite

85

00:07:53,149  -->  00:07:55,460
sensitive in that regard.

86

00:07:55,460  -->  00:07:59,638
Honestly, its behavior can seem a bit weird
if you are not familiar with it.

87

00:08:00,750  -->  00:08:05,849
If you prefer to use other HTTP clients, it
should be fairly easy to replicate this in

88

00:08:05,849  -->  00:08:07,964
Postman or something like that.

89

00:08:08,695  -->  00:08:10,941
Alright, I’ll see you in the next lecture.
