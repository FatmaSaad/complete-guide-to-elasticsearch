We've covered a lot of ground in this section.

You should now be up and running with both Elasticsearch and Kibana, regardless of whether or not you set things up on your own machine or decided to use Elastic Cloud.

You learned what the basic architecture of Elasticsearch looks like, so you should now have a decent understanding of what clusters, nodes, indices, and documents are about.

We also covered sharding and replication, which is what enables Elasticsearch to scale and ensure high availability.

We also briefly discussed how Elasticsearch supports snapshots as a way of backing up data.

You also learned how to add additional nodes to a cluster for development purposes, and we covered how nodes in Elasticsearch have various roles that we can configure.

With all of that out of the way, we are now ready to begin actually using our Elasticsearch cluster.

Naturally we'll need some data to work with, so the next section is about performing basic operations on documents, along with some other goodies along the way.

I'll see you in the next section!
