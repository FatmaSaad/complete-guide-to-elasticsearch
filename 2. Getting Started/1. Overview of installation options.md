1

00:00:02,610  -->  00:00:08,099
Now that you know what Elasticsearch and the
Elastic Stack is all about, let's get started

2

00:00:08,100  -->  00:00:10,080
actually doing something with it.

3

00:00:11,060  -->  00:00:15,680
The first step in doing so is to install Elasticsearch
and Kibana.

4

00:00:16,400  -->  00:00:22,590
The reason we need Kibana, is that it has
a very convenient development tool named Console,

5

00:00:22,590  -->  00:00:26,560
which lets us easily send queries to Elasticsearch.

6

00:00:27,680  -->  00:00:32,880
The next handful of lectures are going to
cover how to set up both Elasticsearch and

7

00:00:32,880  -->  00:00:37,000
Kibana on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

8

00:00:37,660  -->  00:00:42,860
While it's fairly easy, there is actually
a shortcut where you don't have to install

9

00:00:42,860  -->  00:00:44,160
anything at all.

10

00:00:45,000  -->  00:00:51,020
That's because the company behind Elasticsearch
and the Elastic Stack has a cloud solution.

11

00:00:52,260  -->  00:00:57,300
There is a free trial, which is sufficient
for working your way through this course.

12

00:00:57,900  -->  00:01:03,600
So if you don't want to deal with installation
and any issues that may come from it, then

13

00:01:03,600  -->  00:01:05,800
this is the easiest approach.

14

00:01:06,530  -->  00:01:11,320
You just have to click a few buttons, and
everything is ready and set up for you, so

15

00:01:11,320  -->  00:01:14,800
you don't need to deal with any configuration
files at all.

16

00:01:16,100  -->  00:01:21,860
If you are just getting started with Elasticsearch,
then that's the approach that I recommend.

17

00:01:22,420  -->  00:01:28,140
When you have gained some experience with
Elasticsearch - or if your trial expires - then

18

00:01:28,140  -->  00:01:31,950
you can always go ahead and install everything
on your own machine.

19

00:01:32,560  -->  00:01:37,159
I have attached a link to the Elastic Cloud
trial to this lecture, and I will show you

20

00:01:37,160  -->  00:01:39,680
how to set everything up in the next lecture.

21

00:01:41,180  -->  00:01:47,020
The other alternative is to set things up
the traditional way, being on your machine.

22

00:01:47,620  -->  00:01:53,160
As I mentioned a moment ago, I will cover
how to do this on both Linux based systems,

23

00:01:53,160  -->  00:01:54,680
and on Windows.

24

00:01:55,520  -->  00:02:01,659
Actually there is another approach as well;
running Elasticsearch and Kibana within Docker

25

00:02:01,660  -->  00:02:02,660
containers.

26

00:02:03,700  -->  00:02:07,980
If you are not familiar with Docker, then
you can simply ignore this option.

27

00:02:08,900  -->  00:02:13,600
I don't officially support that approach
in this course, but I have attached a link

28

00:02:13,600  -->  00:02:16,540
to the documentation if you want to give it
a try.

29

00:02:18,160  -->  00:02:23,640
As you can see, you have a couple of options,
so please find the lectures that are relevant

30

00:02:23,650  -->  00:02:28,490
to the approach that you prefer, and you can
skip the ones that cover platforms that are

31

00:02:28,490  -->  00:02:29,720
not relevant to you.

32

00:02:30,880  -->  00:02:34,760
Alright, let's get started setting up Elasticsearch
and Kibana!
