00:00:02,620  -->  00:00:07,160
As you know, an Elasticsearch cluster consists
of one or more nodes.

2

00:00:07,600  -->  00:00:11,220
Data is stored on shards, and shards are stored
on nodes.

3

00:00:11,840  -->  00:00:16,460
Until now, every node that you have seen,
has stored one or more shards.

4

00:00:17,080  -->  00:00:21,540
A node will typically store shards, but it
might not always be the case, though.

5

00:00:22,100  -->  00:00:27,240
That's because each node can have one or
more roles, defining what the node is used for.

6

00:00:27,780  -->  00:00:30,080
Let's take a look at the roles that are
available.

7

00:00:32,500  -->  00:00:37,820
First up, we have the "master" role, which
makes a node eligible for being the cluster's

8

00:00:37,820  -->  00:00:38,400
master node.

9

00:00:38,820  -->  00:00:42,880
We haven't talked about what a master node
is yet, and I don't want to go into a lot

10

00:00:42,900  -->  00:00:47,280
of details now, because it's actually a
quite complicated subject.

11

00:00:48,720  -->  00:00:53,640
Essentially a master node is responsible for
performing cluster-wide actions.

12

00:00:54,020  -->  00:00:59,519
This mainly includes creating and deleting
indices, keeping track of nodes, and allocating

13

00:00:59,520  -->  00:01:00,980
shards to nodes.

14

00:01:02,500  -->  00:01:07,600
Giving this role to a node does not automatically
make it the master node, unless there are

15

00:01:07,600  -->  00:01:09,440
no other nodes with this role.

16

00:01:10,360  -->  00:01:15,900
The reason is that the cluster's master
node will be elected based on a voting process,

17

00:01:15,900  -->  00:01:20,910
so if you have several nodes with this role,
either one of them may be elected as the master

18

00:01:20,910  -->  00:01:21,420
node.

19

00:01:22,660  -->  00:01:27,600
For large clusters, it is often useful to
have dedicated master nodes.

20

00:01:28,060  -->  00:01:33,580
That's because having a stable master node
is crucial for ensuring that the cluster is stable.

21

00:01:34,100  -->  00:01:39,380
If the elected master node is too busy doing
other things - such as serving search requests

22

00:01:40,020  -->  00:01:43,000
- then cluster stability may be affected.

23

00:01:44,240  -->  00:01:50,020
Searching for data and modifying it is expensive
in terms of hardware resources, so if you

24

00:01:50,020  -->  00:01:56,270
see high CPU, memory and I/O usage on your
master node, then it might be time to add

25

00:01:56,270  -->  00:01:57,940
a dedicated master node.

26

00:01:59,500  -->  00:02:01,700
Next, we have the "data" role.

27

00:02:02,100  -->  00:02:07,740
As its name implies, this role enables a node
to store a part of the cluster's data.

28

00:02:08,280  -->  00:02:14,240
Not only that, it also performs queries such
as search queries and modifications of data.

29

00:02:15,540  -->  00:02:21,060
Storage of data therefore goes hand in hand
with serving queries that are related to the

30

00:02:21,080  -->  00:02:21,720
stored data.

31

00:02:22,400  -->  00:02:28,860
A node will typically have this role - especially
for small to medium sized clusters - but a

32

00:02:28,860  -->  00:02:32,040
node won't store any shards if this role
is disabled.

33

00:02:33,860  -->  00:02:38,780
I mentioned that for large and busy clusters,
there might be a point in time where it is

34

00:02:38,780  -->  00:02:41,560
useful to introduce dedicated master nodes.

35

00:02:42,120  -->  00:02:47,380
A part of doing that, is to disable the "data"
role for the master-eligible nodes.

36

00:02:48,240  -->  00:02:52,880
You will then have other nodes that do contain
the "data" role and not the "master" role.

37

00:02:53,820  -->  00:02:59,260
The main purpose of having dedicated data
nodes is therefore to separate master and

38

00:02:59,260  -->  00:03:00,260
data nodes.

39

00:03:02,000  -->  00:03:07,040
The next role I will talk about is the one
named "ingest," which enables a node to

40

00:03:07,040  -->  00:03:08,880
run ingest pipelines.

41

00:03:09,600  -->  00:03:12,260
That requires a bit of background knowledge.

42

00:03:12,840  -->  00:03:18,060
An ingest pipeline is a series of steps that
should be performed when ingesting a document

43

00:03:18,060  -->  00:03:19,520
into Elasticsearch.

44

00:03:20,460  -->  00:03:23,780
Ingesting refers to adding a document to an
index.

45

00:03:24,340  -->  00:03:29,800
The steps are formally referred to as processors,
and they may manipulate documents before they

46

00:03:29,800  -->  00:03:34,920
are added to an index, such as adding and
removing fields, or changing values.

47

00:03:36,060  -->  00:03:41,379
An example would be to ingest a web server's
access log, where each request is stored as

48

00:03:41,380  -->  00:03:43,200
an Elasticsearch document.

49

00:03:43,960  -->  00:03:49,900
We could then transform the visitor's IP
address into geographical data such as latitude,

50

00:03:49,900  -->  00:03:51,820
longitude, country, etc.

51

00:03:53,020  -->  00:03:58,460
You can think of an Elasticsearch ingest pipeline
as a simplified Logstash pipeline, as it provides

52

00:03:58,460  -->  00:04:00,960
a subset of the Logstash functionality.

53

00:04:02,240  -->  00:04:07,640
You can build fairly complex ingest pipelines
that perform a lot of data transformations,

54

00:04:07,640  -->  00:04:12,320
but if you need the full functionality, then
Logstash is the way to go.

55

00:04:13,500  -->  00:04:19,620
That being said, ingest pipelines are useful
for relatively simple data transformations.

56

00:04:20,720  -->  00:04:26,220
If you are ingesting a high volume of documents,
then running them all through an ingest pipeline

57

00:04:26,220  -->  00:04:29,680
may be expensive in terms of hardware resources.

58

00:04:30,820  -->  00:04:34,980
Some of the Elastic Stack products ship with
ingest pipelines.

59

00:04:35,360  -->  00:04:41,480
For example, if you use Filebeat to ingest
Apache access logs, each line of the access

60

00:04:41,490  -->  00:04:46,530
log will be run through an ingest pipeline
before being stored within an Elasticsearch

61

00:04:46,530  -->  00:04:47,380
index.

62

00:04:48,520  -->  00:04:54,800
As you might imagine, running a busy website
or API will yield a lot of documents.

63

00:04:55,600  -->  00:05:00,040
That's why it's possible to enable or
disable ingest pipelines for a node.

64

00:05:00,500  -->  00:05:05,410
If you run a lot of documents through a pipeline,
you might consider having a dedicated node

65

00:05:05,410  -->  00:05:06,200
for this.

66

00:05:08,180  -->  00:05:13,920
If you intend to make use of machine learning,
there are two settings related to this feature.

67

00:05:13,920  -->  00:05:20,120
The first one, named "node.ml," identifies
a node as a machine learning node if set to "true."

68

00:05:21,360  -->  00:05:24,640
This enables the node to run machine
learning jobs.

69

00:05:24,980  -->  00:05:31,880
The second setting is named "xpack.ml.enabled,"
which enables or disables the node's capability

70

00:05:31,880  -->  00:05:35,000
of responding to machine learning API requests.

71

00:05:36,340  -->  00:05:41,100
If you make use of machine learning, then
these two settings enable you to run dedicated

72

00:05:41,100  -->  00:05:42,580
machine learning nodes.

73

00:05:42,880  -->  00:05:47,440
That might be useful if you don't want your
background machine learning jobs to slow other

74

00:05:47,440  -->  00:05:50,240
things down, such as search requests.

75

00:05:52,520  -->  00:05:58,180
The next role is "coordination node."
By "coordination," I am referring to how

76

00:05:58,180  -->  00:06:01,220
Elasticsearch distributes queries internally.

77

00:06:01,920  -->  00:06:07,540
We haven't talked about how requests are
routed and coordinated yet, but we will soon.

78

00:06:08,180  -->  00:06:14,120
For now, just know that a so-called coordination
node is a node that is responsible for processing

79

00:06:14,120  -->  00:06:18,920
a request and handling the delegation of work
needed in that process.

80

00:06:19,380  -->  00:06:25,919
To be clear, such a node does not search any
data on its own; such work is delegated to

81

00:06:25,920  -->  00:06:27,140
data nodes.

82

00:06:28,100  -->  00:06:33,600
Having a node only serve as a coordination
node is actually not possible through a single

83

00:06:33,600  -->  00:06:36,500
setting, because there is no role available
for doing so.

84

00:06:37,720  -->  00:06:42,000
Instead, this is accomplished by removing
the other roles from a node.

85

00:06:42,460  -->  00:06:45,940
All that's left then, is the coordination
of queries.

86

00:06:46,540  -->  00:06:52,300
Having dedicated coordination nodes is only
really useful for large clusters, as it can

87

00:06:52,300  -->  00:06:54,680
essentially be used as a load balancer.

88

00:06:56,720  -->  00:07:00,060
The last role, is one that I will just name
drop.

89

00:07:00,060  -->  00:07:01,820
It's called voting-only.

90

00:07:02,370  -->  00:07:06,760
I won't go into detail with this role, because
the chances that you will ever need to use

91

00:07:06,760  -->  00:07:09,360
this role, are close to 0%.

92

00:07:10,740  -->  00:07:16,599
What it basically does, is that a node with
this role will participate in the voting process

93

00:07:16,600  -->  00:07:21,940
when electing a new master node, but it cannot
be elected as the master node itself.

94

00:07:22,540  -->  00:07:25,600
This role is only useful for large clusters.

95

00:07:27,960  -->  00:07:30,940
So which roles do our nodes actually have?

96

00:07:31,620  -->  00:07:34,980
You have actually seen that before, but I
just didn't mention it.

97

00:07:35,540  -->  00:07:39,320
Let's head over to Kibana and take a look
at the nodes within our cluster.

98

00:07:40,820  -->  00:07:48,780
There are two columns of interest to us; "node.role"
and "master." The first column specifies

99

00:07:48,780  -->  00:07:51,080
which roles a given node has.

100

00:07:52,080  -->  00:07:57,780
The roles are abbreviated, so "dim" is
short for "data," "ingest," and "master."

101

00:07:58,910  -->  00:08:04,340
As you can see, all of our nodes have these
three roles, meaning that these are the default

102

00:08:04,340  -->  00:08:07,280
roles that are used unless configured otherwise.

103

00:08:08,640  -->  00:08:14,020
This also means that all of our three nodes
are eligible to be elected as the master node.

104

00:08:14,580  -->  00:08:18,280
In this case, the first node was chosen as
the master.

105

00:08:18,940  -->  00:08:23,159
That's because it's the first node that
was started up, and since there were no other

106

00:08:23,160  -->  00:08:27,800
nodes available at that point in time, that
node had to become the master.

107

00:08:28,640  -->  00:08:32,760
That's also why you saw me checking the
output of the first node when adding additional

108

00:08:32,760  -->  00:08:35,540
nodes to the cluster in the previous lecture.

109

00:08:37,660  -->  00:08:41,720
Now that you know which roles are available,
let's talk a bit about when you will want

110

00:08:41,720  -->  00:08:42,760
to change them.

111

00:08:43,320  -->  00:08:48,380
As with determining the optimal number of
shards that an index should have, the answer

112

00:08:48,380  -->  00:08:49,980
is that it depends.

113

00:08:51,300  -->  00:08:56,840
That being said, modifying the roles of nodes,
is almost always something you will do for

114

00:08:56,840  -->  00:08:59,540
large clusters and not small ones.

115

00:09:00,260  -->  00:09:05,040
Besides the size of the cluster, you will
typically also want to do this when you need

116

00:09:05,040  -->  00:09:10,120
to scale the throughput of the cluster, i.e.
when hardware usage is high.

117

00:09:11,660  -->  00:09:15,880
You will commonly want to tweak the number
of shards and nodes first, however.

118

00:09:16,480  -->  00:09:21,680
Another reason for changing roles for a large
cluster, is just that it makes it easier to

119

00:09:21,680  -->  00:09:26,420
understand how the hardware resources are
being used and optimize your cluster based

120

00:09:26,420  -->  00:09:27,120
on that.

121

00:09:28,560  -->  00:09:32,980
As a rule of thumb, you shouldn't change
any roles if you don't know what you are

122

00:09:32,980  -->  00:09:36,040
doing, or if you don't have a good reason
for doing so.

123

00:09:36,760  -->  00:09:41,640
This is something that can always be done
at a later point, so you will almost always

124

00:09:41,640  -->  00:09:45,180
want to stick with the default roles until
you need to change them.

125

00:09:46,480  -->  00:09:51,240
This also means that the purpose of showing
them to you, is not for you to go ahead and

126

00:09:51,250  -->  00:09:56,760
change the roles, but just for you to be aware
of the possibility of doing so, in case you

127

00:09:56,760  -->  00:09:57,800
ever need to.
