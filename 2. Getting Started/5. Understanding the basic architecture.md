00:00:02,330  -->  00:00:08,430
Now that we have successfully installed Elasticsearch
and Kibana, let's talk a bit about the architecture

2

00:00:08,430  -->  00:00:09,920
of Elasticsearch.

3

00:00:10,640  -->  00:00:15,920
So when we started up Elasticsearch, what
actually happened, was that we started up

4

00:00:15,920  -->  00:00:16,640
a node.

5

00:00:17,380  -->  00:00:22,280
A node is essentially an instance of Elasticsearch
that stores data.

6

00:00:23,180  -->  00:00:28,410
To ensure that we can store many terabytes
of data if we need to, we can run as many

7

00:00:28,410  -->  00:00:29,860
nodes as we want.

8

00:00:30,600  -->  00:00:33,820
Each node will then store a part of our data.

9

00:00:34,700  -->  00:00:40,800
This way, we can store data on multiple virtual
or physical machines, which enables us to

10

00:00:40,809  -->  00:00:46,830
store many terabytes of data, even if each
machine only has a disk capacity of a few

11

00:00:46,830  -->  00:00:48,260
hundred gigabytes.

12

00:00:49,340  -->  00:00:55,860
A node refers to an instance of Elasticsearch
and not a machine, so you can run any number

13

00:00:55,860  -->  00:00:57,920
of nodes on the same machine.

14

00:00:58,720  -->  00:01:04,320
This means that on your development machine,
you can start up five nodes if you want to,

15

00:01:04,320  -->  00:01:08,000
without having to deal with virtual machines
or containers.

16

00:01:08,880  -->  00:01:14,560
That being said, you should typically separate
things in a production environment so that

17

00:01:14,560  -->  00:01:20,120
each node runs on a dedicated machine, a virtual
machine, or within a container.

18

00:01:21,240  -->  00:01:24,160
You might wonder how all of this is coordinated.

19

00:01:24,920  -->  00:01:30,740
How is the data distributed across the nodes,
and how does Elasticsearch know where some

20

00:01:30,740  -->  00:01:32,460
given data is stored?

21

00:01:33,280  -->  00:01:38,520
We will discuss this in detail in the next
couple of lectures, but the short answer to

22

00:01:38,520  -->  00:01:43,200
the question is that each node belongs to
what is called a cluster.

23

00:01:44,040  -->  00:01:50,020
A cluster is a collection of related nodes
that together contain all of our data.

24

00:01:50,640  -->  00:01:56,060
We can have many clusters if we want to, but
one is usually enough.

25

00:01:57,120  -->  00:02:00,960
Clusters are completely independent of each
other by default.

26

00:02:01,520  -->  00:02:07,660
It is possible to perform cross-cluster searches,
but it is not very common to do so.

27

00:02:08,760  -->  00:02:15,240
You might run multiple clusters that serve
different purposes; for instance, you could

28

00:02:15,240  -->  00:02:20,450
have a cluster for powering the search of
an e-commerce application, and another for

29

00:02:20,450  -->  00:02:24,720
Application Performance Management (abbreviated
APM).

30

00:02:25,740  -->  00:02:31,160
The reasons for splitting things into multiple
clusters, are typically to separate things

31

00:02:31,160  -->  00:02:34,740
logically, and to be able to configure things
differently.

32

00:02:35,760  -->  00:02:41,900
That being said, one cluster is typically
enough, so we will be working with a single

33

00:02:41,900  -->  00:02:43,700
cluster throughout this course.

34

00:02:44,220  -->  00:02:50,520
But wait a minute, a moment ago I said that
we started up a node, so how do we create

35

00:02:50,520  -->  00:02:51,600
a cluster?

36

00:02:52,400  -->  00:02:58,980
What actually happened when we started up
the node, was that a cluster was formed automatically.

37

00:02:59,720  -->  00:03:06,060
When a node starts up, it will either join
an existing cluster if configured to do so,

38

00:03:06,060  -->  00:03:10,320
or it will create its own cluster consisting
of just that node.

39

00:03:11,520  -->  00:03:17,560
An Elasticsearch node will always be part
of a cluster, even if there are no other nodes.

40

00:03:19,020  -->  00:03:25,080
There are some problems with only having a
single node in terms of availability and scalability,

41

00:03:25,540  -->  00:03:30,800
but for development purposes, it is perfectly
fine to have a cluster consisting of a single

42

00:03:30,800  -->  00:03:31,600
node.

43

00:03:32,180  -->  00:03:37,180
We will get back to these problems soon, but
right now I don't want to confuse you with

44

00:03:37,180  -->  00:03:37,980
that.

45

00:03:39,490  -->  00:03:44,660
Now that you know what clusters and nodes
are, let's take a closer look at how data

46

00:03:44,660  -->  00:03:46,580
is organized and stored.

47

00:03:47,340  -->  00:03:52,380
Each unit of data that you store within your
cluster is called a document.

48

00:03:53,200  -->  00:03:57,760
Documents are JSON objects containing whatever
data you desire.

49

00:03:58,860  -->  00:04:05,720
When you index a document, the original JSON
object that you sent to Elasticsearch is stored

50

00:04:05,720  -->  00:04:09,260
along with some metadata that Elasticsearch
uses internally.

51

00:04:10,760  -->  00:04:15,440
If you want to store a person, your object
could look something like this.

52

00:04:16,220  -->  00:04:21,560
As you can see, the object contains two fields,
being "name" and "country."

53

00:04:22,620  -->  00:04:28,100
You can add any fields that you want, so you are in total control of this object.

54

00:04:29,480  -->  00:04:35,040
To the right, you can see an example of how
this object would be stored within Elasticsearch.

55

00:04:35,980  -->  00:04:42,240
The JSON object that we send to Elasticsearch
is stored within a field named "_source,"

56

00:04:42,680  -->  00:04:47,180
and Elasticsearch then stores some metadata
together with that object.

57

00:04:48,140  -->  00:04:53,360
Don't worry about what any of that means
though, as we will get to that later in the course.

58

00:04:54,320  -->  00:04:57,700
So how are documents organized, you might
wonder?

59

00:04:58,320  -->  00:05:01,000
The answer is within indices.

60

00:05:01,600  -->  00:05:06,440
Every document within Elasticsearch, is stored
within an index.

61

00:05:07,140  -->  00:05:13,140
An index groups documents together logically,
as well as provide configuration options that

62

00:05:13,140  -->  00:05:18,300
are related to scalability and availability,
which we will take a look at a bit later.

63

00:05:19,260  -->  00:05:25,400
An index is therefore a collection of documents
that have similar characteristics and are

64

00:05:25,400  -->  00:05:26,800
logically related.

65

00:05:27,780  -->  00:05:33,700
For example, the document that you saw a moment
ago, could be stored within an index named

66

00:05:33,719  -->  00:05:38,930
"people." We could then have a different
index named "departments," containing

67

00:05:38,930  -->  00:05:42,700
a number of departments, each being stored
as a document.

68

00:05:43,760  -->  00:05:49,520
An index may contain as many documents as
you want, so there is no hard limit.

69

00:05:50,680  -->  00:05:55,719
When we get to searching for data, you will
see that we specify the index that we want

70

00:05:55,720  -->  00:06:01,949
to search for documents, meaning that search
queries are actually run against indices.

71

00:06:03,280  -->  00:06:08,500
Alright, let's take a short moment to recap
on the key takeaways from this lecture.

72

00:06:09,400  -->  00:06:16,260
An Elasticsearch cluster is a collection of
nodes, which are responsible for storing data.

73

00:06:17,080  -->  00:06:23,620
A node refers to a running instance of Elasticsearch,
which can be running on a physical or virtual

74

00:06:23,620  -->  00:06:27,500
machine, or within a Docker container, for
instance.

75

00:06:28,600  -->  00:06:33,980
Data is stored as documents, with a document
being a unit of information.

76

00:06:34,600  -->  00:06:37,559
A document can represent anything you want.

77

00:06:38,200  -->  00:06:44,980
A few examples are a person, company, product,
review, event, etc.

78

00:06:45,960  -->  00:06:51,620
Each document belongs to an index, which is
a way to logically group together related

79

00:06:51,620  -->  00:06:52,840
documents.

80

00:06:53,400  -->  00:06:56,820
There is more to it than that, but we will
get to that later.
