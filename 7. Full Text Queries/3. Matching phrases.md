You just saw how to use the match query which operates on terms by default.

Documents will match if any of the terms appear within the field that we're searching.

But you also saw how to change that to require all terms to be present with the match query.

It doesn't matter which order the terms appear in or if there are any other terms between two matching terms.

But what if we wanted to match phrases, i.e.

terms in a specific order that can easily be done with a variation of the match query named match underscore phrase.

Like I said, this query matches phrases, i.e.

sequences of words or more formally terms.

Let's see an example which searches for the term spaghetti puts an Oscar which matches what I have in my test data.

So the query is match on the score phrase, and that should be an object.

As always, the fields will be title.

And like I said, the query is spaghetti poo.

Niska like.

So let's run it.

So this query matches one document that begins with a phrase that we are searching for.

Let's now try to switch around the two terms and see the results.

Now the document doesn't match anymore.

That's because the order of terms matters with the match phrase query, unlike the match query.

So both the puts Anezka and spaghetti terms must appear in the title fields in that order, and with no other terms in between for this query to match.
