# Matching phrases

You just saw how to use the match query which operates on terms by default.

Documents will match if any of the terms appear within the field that we're searching.

But you also saw how to change that to require all terms to be present with the match query.

It doesn't matter which order the terms appear in or if there are any other terms between two matching terms.

But what if we wanted to match phrases, i.e.

terms in a specific order that can easily be done with a variation of the match query named match underscore phrase.

Like I said, this query matches phrases, i.e.

sequences of words or more formally terms.

Let's see an example which searches for the term spaghetti puts an Oscar which matches what I have in my test data.

## The order of terms matters

```
GET /recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_phrase": {
      "title": "spaghetti puttanesca"
    }
  }
}
```
So the query is match on the score phrase, and that should be an object.

As always, the fields will be title.

And like I said, the query is spaghetti poo.

Niska like.

So let's run it.

            "Add tomatoes, stir to combine, and bring to a bare simmer. Continue to simmer until pasta is cooked to just under al dente (about 1 minute less than the package recommends).",
            "Using tongs, transfer pasta to sauce. Alternatively, drain pasta through a colander, reserving 1 cup of the cooking water. Add drained pasta to sauce.",
            "Add a few tablespoons of pasta water to sauce and increase heat to bring pasta and sauce to a vigorous simmer. Cook, stirring and shaking the pan and adding more pasta water as necessary to keep sauce loose, until pasta is perfectly al dente, 1 to 2 minutes longer. (The pasta will cook more slowly in the sauce than it did in the water.) Stir in remaining olive oil, parsley, and cheese.",
            "Season with salt and pepper. (Be generous with the pepper and scant with the salt—the dish will be plenty salty from the other ingredients.) If using, stir in canned tuna and break it up with a fork. Serve immediately with more grated cheese at the table."

            },
            {
              "name" : "Kosher salt"
            },
            {
              "name" : "Extra-virgin olive oil",
              "quantity" : "6 tablespoons"
            },
            {

            {

            },
            {
              "name" : "Capers",
              "quantity" : "1/4 cup"
            },
            {
              "name" : "Pitted black olives",
              "quantity" : "1/4 cup"
            },
            {
              "name" : "Whole peeled tomatoes",
              "quantity" : "225g"
            },
            {
              "name" : "Minced fresh parsley leaves",
              "quantity" : "Small handful"
            },
            {
              "name" : "Finely grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese",
              "quantity" : "30g"
            },
            {
              "name" : "Freshly ground black pepper"
            },
            {
              "name" : "Can oil-packed tuna",
              "quantity" : "140g"
            }
          ],
          "created" : "2011/02/21",
          "ratings" : [
            0.5,
            1.0,
            0.5,
            1.5,
            2.0
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

So this query matches one document that begins with a phrase that we are searching for.

Let's now try to switch around the two terms and see the results.

```
GET /recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_phrase": {
      "title": "puttanesca spaghetti"
    }
  }
}
```
```
{
  "took" : 17,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 0,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  }
}
```
Now the document doesn't match anymore.

That's because the order of terms matters with the match phrase query, unlike the match query.

So both the puts Anezka and spaghetti terms must appear in the title fields in that order, and with no other terms in between for this query to match.
