00:00:02,300  -->  00:00:07,040
In the previous section, we got our hands
dirty by writing a bunch of queries.

2

00:00:07,380  -->  00:00:13,040
Among others, we indexed some documents and
covered some aspects of how that works internally.

3

00:00:13,660  -->  00:00:15,860
We were just scratching the surface though.

4

00:00:16,240  -->  00:00:21,040
Not that things are going to be more difficult,
but we just have a couple of new topics to

5

00:00:21,040  -->  00:00:24,780
cover — namely mapping and text analysis.

6

00:00:25,420  -->  00:00:29,520
We will cover both of these topics in this
section of the course, because they are so

7

00:00:29,520  -->  00:00:33,620
closely related that it makes sense to introduce
them at the same time.

8

00:00:34,520  -->  00:00:37,180
They are also really fundamental to Elasticsearch.

9

00:00:38,360  -->  00:00:40,960
Let’s begin by talking about what analysis
is.
