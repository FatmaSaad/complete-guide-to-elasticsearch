00:00:02,580  -->  00:00:07,960
When we added the mapping for the “reviews”
index, we mapped an “author” field as an object.

2

00:00:08,900  -->  00:00:14,500
In Elasticsearch, objects are mapped implicitly
by using the “properties” mapping parameter

3

00:00:14,520  -->  00:00:16,140
at each level of the hierarchy.

4

00:00:17,140  -->  00:00:20,220
You can see the query that we ran at the top
of the Console tool.

5

00:00:21,180  -->  00:00:25,720
Since the “author” field doesn’t contain
any nested objects, the mapping doesn’t

6

00:00:25,720  -->  00:00:29,940
look too bad, but for more advanced mappings,
it can look a little bit messy.

7

00:00:31,280  -->  00:00:36,720
Instead of defining objects in this way, we
can use an alternative approach; by using

8

00:00:36,720  -->  00:00:38,220
a dot notation.

9

00:00:39,380  -->  00:00:45,680
The way it works is that we add a dot at each
level of the hierarchy, i.e. as a field separator.

10

00:00:46,400  -->  00:00:50,220
In this case, we can write “author.first_name,”
for instance.

11

00:00:51,280  -->  00:00:57,060
This format is a bit easier on the eyes, particularly
if you intend to nest objects further than

12

00:00:57,060  -->  00:00:58,080
just one level.

13

00:00:59,560  -->  00:01:04,540
I have rewritten the query to use this syntax
in advance and used a new index name to avoid

14

00:01:04,540  -->  00:01:06,400
a conflict with the existing one.

15

00:01:08,040  -->  00:01:11,500
Let’s retrieve the mapping for the newly
created index.

16

00:01:13,300  -->  00:01:18,200
As we can see, the mapping looks exactly the
same as it did with our previous approach.

17

00:01:18,660  -->  00:01:24,540
This is because Elasticsearch translates fields
using a dot notation into using the “properties”

18

00:01:24,540  -->  00:01:26,520
parameter behind the scenes.

19

00:01:27,520  -->  00:01:32,440
You will therefore never see an index’ mapping
contain the dot notation, as this is simply

20

00:01:32,460  -->  00:01:34,480
a shortcut while creating the mapping.

21

00:01:35,840  -->  00:01:41,459
Note that this dot notation is not exclusive
to defining field mappings; it can also be

22

00:01:41,460  -->  00:01:43,300
used within search queries.

23

00:01:43,980  -->  00:01:48,920
Anyway, I just wanted to show you this handy
little trick, so that’s all for this lecture.
