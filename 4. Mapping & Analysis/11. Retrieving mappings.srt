00:00:02,610  -->  00:00:07,240
Now that we have created a mapping for the
“reviews” index, I want to quickly show

2

00:00:07,240  -->  00:00:09,040
you how to retrieve mappings.

3

00:00:10,360  -->  00:00:14,660
Since we specified the mapping ourselves in
the previous lecture, there won’t be any

4

00:00:14,660  -->  00:00:15,900
surprises here.

5

00:00:16,500  -->  00:00:21,580
However, when using dynamic mapping, it may
sometimes be useful to check how Elasticsearch

6

00:00:21,580  -->  00:00:25,420
has mapped fields based on the documents that
have been indexed.

7

00:00:26,520  -->  00:00:32,400
To retrieve the mapping for an index, we can
send a GET request to the Mapping API as follows.

8

00:00:41,880  -->  00:00:46,100
The results essentially show the same thing
that we typed out in the previous lecture.

9

00:00:46,560  -->  00:00:51,880
In addition to retrieving mappings for the
entire index, it is also possible to retrieve

10

00:00:51,880  -->  00:00:53,740
the mapping for a specific field.

11

00:00:54,480  -->  00:00:58,940
To do that, we simply use the “field”
command, followed by the name of the field.

12

00:00:59,400  -->  00:01:02,100
Let me just type that out so you can see what
it looks like.

13

00:01:13,680  -->  00:01:19,960
For objects, you can specify the path of a
key using a dot notation, such as “author.email.”

14

00:01:28,440  -->  00:01:30,180
That was pretty easy, right?

15

00:01:30,600  -->  00:01:34,460
Now that you know how to retrieve an index’
mapping, let’s continue.
