might already have been indexed with the existing field mapping.

If we could just change the mapping, we would have to reindex any existing documents.

For instance, changing a “text” field to a “keyword” field is not possible, because values have already been analyzed.

Our failed attempt to change the “long” data type to “keyword” also didn’t work.

Remember how numeric values are indexed into a BKD tree.

Switching to the “keyword” data type would require that data structure to be converted to an inverted index, which is essentially the same as reindexing all of the field’s values.

If you have indexed many millions of documents, that is going to take a while.

Even if we haven’t indexed any documents since adding a field mapping, we are still not allowed to update it.

On top of that, you also cannot remove a field mapping once you have added it.

While that may sound strange, remember that the mapping will not be used if a field value is not supplied when indexing a document, so we can simply ignore the field moving forward.

If we want to reclaim the storage space used by the field, we could use the Update By Query API and remove the field from each matching document with a script.

There are all kinds of challenges involved with updating existing field mappings, some of which don’t even have to do with changing the data type.

Changing a field mapping almost always requires documents to be reindexed.

That’s why Elasticsearch protects us by simply not allowing existing mappings to be updated - except for a small number of parameters.

So if we cannot update the data type for our “product_id” field, then what do we do?

We create a new index with the updated mapping and reindex any existing documents into it.

Let’s see how to do that in the next lecture.
