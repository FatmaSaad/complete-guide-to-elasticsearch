1

00:00:02,590  -->  00:00:08,580
Now that you know the basics of text analysis
and how the resulting terms are stored, let’s

2

00:00:08,580  -->  00:00:10,480
move on to talking about mapping.

3

00:00:11,600  -->  00:00:17,980
We will revisit the concept of analysis, because
as you will soon find out, mapping and analysis

4

00:00:17,980  -->  00:00:19,720
are quite closely related.

5

00:00:21,360  -->  00:00:23,780
So what is mapping all about?

6

00:00:24,440  -->  00:00:29,780
Mapping defines the structure of documents
and how they are indexed and stored.

7

00:00:30,640  -->  00:00:34,560
This includes the fields of a document and
their data types.

8

00:00:35,040  -->  00:00:41,760
As a simplification, you can think of it as the equivalent of a table schema in a relational database.

9

00:00:43,220  -->  00:00:50,380
On your screen, you can see how a simple table in a relational database could be mapped in Elasticsearch.

10

00:00:51,220  -->  00:00:56,280
There is more to Elasticsearch mapping than
this, so this is just a way for you to wrap

11

00:00:56,280  -->  00:00:59,760
your head around the general idea of what
mapping is.

12

00:01:01,060  -->  00:01:06,920
Simply defining the fields and their data
types is not that exciting, so luckily there

13

00:01:06,920  -->  00:01:08,800
is much more to it than that.

14

00:01:09,480  -->  00:01:14,120
Mapping is actually pretty cool and not quite
as boring as it sounds.

15

00:01:15,440  -->  00:01:22,080
In Elasticsearch, there are two basic approaches
to mapping; explicit and dynamic mapping.

16

00:01:22,880  -->  00:01:28,560
With explicit mapping, we define fields and
their data types ourselves, typically when

17

00:01:28,560  -->  00:01:30,060
creating an index.

18

00:01:30,740  -->  00:01:33,860
That’s exactly what you saw on the diagram
a moment ago.

19

00:01:35,000  -->  00:01:40,389
To make Elasticsearch easier to use, a field
mapping will automatically be created when

20

00:01:40,389  -->  00:01:42,860
Elasticsearch encounters a new field.

21

00:01:44,080  -->  00:01:48,800
It will inspect the supplied field value to
figure out how the field should be mapped.

22

00:01:49,640  -->  00:01:55,099
If you supply a string value, for instance,
Elasticsearch will use the “text” data

23

00:01:55,100  -->  00:01:55,980
type for the mapping.

24

00:01:56,960  -->  00:02:03,299
As you will see, explicit and dynamic mapping
can actually be combined, so mapping is quite

25

00:02:03,300  -->  00:02:05,180
flexible in Elasticsearch.

26

00:02:05,940  -->  00:02:07,600
Anyway, let’s get started!
