1

00:00:02,340  -->  00:00:07,720
Now that you have seen both explicit and dynamic
mapping, which one should you choose, then?

2

00:00:08,300  -->  00:00:13,320
I will give you some recommendations in a
couple of lectures, but you don’t necessarily

3

00:00:13,320  -->  00:00:15,060
have to choose one or the other.

4

00:00:15,640  -->  00:00:19,580
That’s because the two approaches can actually
complement each other.

5

00:00:20,080  -->  00:00:21,520
Let me show you an example.

6

00:00:22,460  -->  00:00:25,200
I have prepared a couple of queries in advance.

7

00:00:25,740  -->  00:00:31,460
The first one creates a new index named “people”
with a “text” mapping for a “first_name” field.

8

00:00:31,760  -->  00:00:32,820
Nothing new here.

9

00:00:33,520  -->  00:00:37,580
I have run that query in advance, and you
can see the mapping to the right.

10

00:00:38,620  -->  00:00:42,680
Let’s now index a document containing both
a first and last name.

11

00:00:43,340  -->  00:00:47,640
There is no mapping for the “last_name”
field, so what do you think will happen?

12

00:00:48,200  -->  00:00:50,600
I’m sure you guessed it, but let’s see.

13

00:00:53,520  -->  00:00:55,440
Let’s then retrieve the mapping again.

14

00:00:58,580  -->  00:01:02,620
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the “last_name”
field has now been mapped.

15

00:01:03,180  -->  00:01:09,020
That’s because dynamic mapping is enabled
by default and a mapping didn’t exist already.

16

00:01:09,680  -->  00:01:15,000
Elasticsearch will then create a field mapping
automatically in exactly the same way as you

17

00:01:15,000  -->  00:01:16,620
saw in the previous lecture.

18

00:01:17,180  -->  00:01:22,360
The difference here is just that we already
had mappings, just not for that particular field.

19

00:01:23,580  -->  00:01:28,920
That’s really all I wanted to show you in
this lecture; that explicit and dynamic mapping

20

00:01:28,939  -->  00:01:33,219
can be combined, so you don’t necessarily
have to choose one or the other.
