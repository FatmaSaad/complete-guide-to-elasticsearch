00:00:02,620  -->  00:00:07,640
You know how to define mappings, but I only
showed you how to define them for a new index.

2

00:00:07,940  -->  00:00:11,560
What if we already have an index and we want
to add a new field?

3

00:00:11,820  -->  00:00:13,920
That’s what we’ll cover in this lecture.

4

00:00:14,840  -->  00:00:19,560
We added a “reviews” index and defined
the mappings for it, but come to think about

5

00:00:19,560  -->  00:00:24,400
it, we probably want to save the timestamp
of when the review was written as well.

6

00:00:25,180  -->  00:00:30,500
Elasticsearch does not store the timestamp
of when the document was indexed, so we need

7

00:00:30,500  -->  00:00:31,860
to do that ourselves.

8

00:00:33,200  -->  00:00:35,880
Let’s add the mapping for a “created_at”
field.

9

00:00:36,340  -->  00:00:41,240
We will still use the PUT HTTP verb, but this
time we will invoke the Mapping API.

10

00:00:52,880  -->  00:00:57,500
Since we are using the Mapping API, we should
not specify the “mappings” key as we did

11

00:00:57,500  -->  00:00:59,160
when creating the index.

12

00:00:59,480  -->  00:01:04,360
Instead, we specify the “properties” key
at the top level of the request body.

13

00:01:04,980  -->  00:01:08,700
The rest of the syntax is the same, so let’s
type everything out.

14

00:01:25,940  -->  00:01:29,740
We’ll talk more about the “date” data
type in the next lecture, so let’s just

15

00:01:29,740  -->  00:01:31,500
add the mapping for now.

16

00:01:33,160  -->  00:01:35,140
The mapping has been added successfully.

17

00:01:35,600  -->  00:01:38,940
Let’s retrieve the mapping for the index
just to be sure.

18

00:01:41,040  -->  00:01:43,920
And indeed we see the field mapping within
the results.

19

00:01:44,420  -->  00:01:48,000
That’s how easy it is to add mappings to
an existing index.

20

00:01:48,460  -->  00:01:51,200
Let’s take a closer look at the “date”
data type now.
