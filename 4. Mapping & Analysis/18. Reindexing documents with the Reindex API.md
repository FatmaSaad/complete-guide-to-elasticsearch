# Reindexing documents with the Reindex API

Alright, so as we talked about in the previous lecture, changing how documents are mapped usually requires reindexing documents.

The first step is to create a new index and define the new mapping and optionally any index settings.

Let’s create an updated version of the "reviews" index where the "product_id" field is of the "keyword" data type.

To save some typing, let’s retrieve the current mapping and copy/paste that into the query.

## Retrieve mapping
```
GET /reviews/_mappings
```

All we need to do now is to modify the data type for the "product_id" field.

## Add new index with new mapping
```
PUT /reviews_new
{
  "mappings" : {
    "properties" : {
      "author" : {
        "properties" : {
          "email" : {
            "type" : "keyword",
            "ignore_above" : 256
          },
          "first_name" : {
            "type" : "text"
          },
          "last_name" : {
            "type" : "text"
          }
        }
      },
      "content" : {
        "type" : "text"
      },
      "created_at" : {
        "type" : "date"
      },
      "product_id" : {
        "type" : "keyword"
      },
      "rating" : {
        "type" : "float"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

That’s it.

Let’s run the query.

```
{
  "acknowledged" : true,
  "shards_acknowledged" : true,
  "index" : "reviews_new"
}

```
The index has now been created and we are ready to add documents to it.

But how do we do that?

2022-09-14_22-26

We could write a script that retrieves documents from the old index, modifies them in one way or another, and then indexes them into the new index.

That takes quite a bit of work, especially if we want to reindex a large number of documents.

Instead, Elasticsearch exposes a convenient API specific to this purpose, namely the Reindex API.

This API does the heavy lifting of moving documents from one index to another so that we don’t have to.

That’s because reindexing documents is actually a pretty common thing to do during the lifetime of an index.

Business requirements may change, or perhaps we need to tweak how data is stored when scaling from thousands to hundreds of millions of documents.

Whatever the case, let’s begin typing out the query that moves documents from the old index into the new one.

## Reindex documents into `reviews_new`
```
POST /_reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "reviews"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "reviews_new"
  }
}
```

The HTTP verb is "POST" and the endpoint is simply "_reindex".

We will need to define two parameters named "source" and "dest," both being objects.

Let’s add those to the request body.

The "source" parameter defines where the documents should be retrieved from and how to retrieve them.

For now, let’s just define the index name within a parameter named "index".

Next, let’s define where the documents should be stored, which we also specify with an "index" parameter, this time within the "dest" parameter.

That’s the basic query for reindexing documents.

Let’s run it and see what happens.

```
{
  "took" : 21,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "total" : 5,
  "updated" : 0,
  "created" : 5,
  "deleted" : 0,
  "batches" : 1,
  "version_conflicts" : 0,
  "noops" : 0,
  "retries" : {
    "bulk" : 0,
    "search" : 0
  },
  "throttled_millis" : 0,
  "requests_per_second" : -1.0,
  "throttled_until_millis" : 0,
  "failures" : [ ]
}
```
Everything appears to have worked, and the results state that five documents were reindexed.

Let’s retrieve the documents within the new index to verify that everything looks index.

## Retrieve documents
```
GET /reviews_new/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
```
```
{
  "took" : 1046,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 5,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "reviews_new",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "rating" : 5.0,
          "content" : "Outstanding course! Bo really taught me a lot about Elasticsearch!",
          "product_id" : 123,
          "author" : {
            "first_name" : "John",
            "last_name" : "Doe",
            "email" : "johndoe123@example.com"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "reviews_new",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "2",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "rating" : 4.5,
          "content" : "Not bad. Not bad at all!",
          "product_id" : 123,
          "created_at" : "2015-03-27",
          "author" : {
            "first_name" : "Average",
            "last_name" : "Joe",
            "email" : "avgjoe@example.com"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "reviews_new",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "3",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "rating" : 3.5,
          "content" : "Could be better",
          "product_id" : 123,
          "created_at" : "2015-04-15T13:07:41Z",
          "author" : {
            "first_name" : "Spencer",
            "last_name" : "Pearson",
            "email" : "spearson@example.com"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "reviews_new",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "4",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "rating" : 5.0,
          "content" : "Incredible!",
          "product_id" : 123,
          "created_at" : "2015-01-28T09:21:51+01:00",
          "author" : {
            "first_name" : "Adam",
            "last_name" : "Jones",
            "email" : "adam.jones@example.com"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "reviews_new",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "5",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "rating" : 4.5,
          "content" : "Very useful",
          "product_id" : 123,
          "created_at" : 1436011284000,
          "author" : {
            "first_name" : "Taylor",
            "last_name" : "West",
            "email" : "twest@example.com"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Indeed the five documents are returned.

At a glance, everything looks good, but if we take a closer look, notice how the values or the "product_id" field are numeric and not strings.

To be clear, this has no effect on how the values are indexed - specifically in regards to the inverted index.

This is only a cosmetic thing within the "_source" object.

Remember that this object contains the original values that were supplied at index time.

Us changing the data type doesn’t cause the "_source" object to be modified.

However, when performing search requests, you will typically grab field values from the "_source" object, and it would be fair to assume that you would get a string value back for a "keyword" field.

That’s why it might be a good idea to modify the source document while reindexing the documents.

Alternatively you can just convert the data type within whatever application is querying the index, but I prefer for Elasticsearch to return the expected data type.

The way that we can modify documents during reindexing, is to supply a script that is run for each document.


## Convert `product_id` values to strings
```
POST /_reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "reviews"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "reviews_new"
  },
  "script": {
    "source": """
      if (ctx._source.product_id != null) {
        ctx._source.product_id = ctx._source.product_id.toString();
      }
    """
  }
}
```
The script is defined within a "source" parameter, which is nested within the "script" parameter.

We haven’t talked much about scripting yet, although you have seen some simple examples earlier.

That’s why this example is also a very simple one.

It checks if the "product_id" field is defined within the source document, first of all.

That’s because our reviews didn’t contain a product ID from the beginning, so one of our documents does not contain this field.

If we left out this check, we would get a NullPointerException for that document.

Anyway, the following line simply replaces the value of the "product_id" field within the source document with the existing value converted to a string.

Let’s delete the documents within the new index and reindex the documents again.

To do that, we will use the Delete by Query API.

I have prepared the query in advance, so let’s just go ahead and run it.

## Delete all documents
```
POST /reviews_new/_delete_by_query
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
```
```
{
  "took" : 12,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "total" : 5,
  "deleted" : 5,
  "batches" : 1,
  "version_conflicts" : 0,
  "noops" : 0,
  "retries" : {
    "bulk" : 0,
    "search" : 0
  },
  "throttled_millis" : 0,
  "requests_per_second" : -1.0,
  "throttled_until_millis" : 0,
  "failures" : [ ]
}

```
Now Let’s run the reindex query.

## Convert `product_id` values to strings
```
POST /_reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "reviews"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "reviews_new"
  },
  "script": {
    "source": """
      if (ctx._source.product_id != null) {
        ctx._source.product_id = ctx._source.product_id.toString();
      }
    """
  }
}
```
```
{
  "took" : 19,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "total" : 5,
  "updated" : 0,
  "created" : 5,
  "deleted" : 0,
  "batches" : 1,
  "version_conflicts" : 0,
  "noops" : 0,
  "retries" : {
    "bulk" : 0,
    "search" : 0
  },
  "throttled_millis" : 0,
  "requests_per_second" : -1.0,
  "throttled_until_millis" : 0,
  "failures" : [ ]
}
```
Now that the documents have been reindexed once again, let’s verify that the product IDs have been converted to strings within the "_source" object.

## Retrieve documents
```
GET /reviews_new/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
```
And indeed they have.
```
{
  "took" : 513,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 5,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "reviews_new",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "author" : {
            "last_name" : "Doe",
            "first_name" : "John",
            "email" : "johndoe123@example.com"
          },
          "product_id" : "123",
          "rating" : 5.0,
          "content" : "Outstanding course! Bo really taught me a lot about Elasticsearch!"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "reviews_new",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "2",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "author" : {
            "last_name" : "Joe",
            "first_name" : "Average",
            "email" : "avgjoe@example.com"
          },
          "product_id" : "123",
          "rating" : 4.5,
          "created_at" : "2015-03-27",
          "content" : "Not bad. Not bad at all!"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "reviews_new",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "3",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "author" : {
            "last_name" : "Pearson",
            "first_name" : "Spencer",
            "email" : "spearson@example.com"
          },
          "product_id" : "123",
          "rating" : 3.5,
          "created_at" : "2015-04-15T13:07:41Z",
          "content" : "Could be better"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "reviews_new",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "4",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "author" : {
            "last_name" : "Jones",
            "first_name" : "Adam",
            "email" : "adam.jones@example.com"
          },
          "product_id" : "123",
          "rating" : 5.0,
          "created_at" : "2015-01-28T09:21:51+01:00",
          "content" : "Incredible!"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "reviews_new",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "5",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "author" : {
            "last_name" : "West",
            "first_name" : "Taylor",
            "email" : "twest@example.com"
          },
          "product_id" : "123",
          "rating" : 4.5,
          "created_at" : 1436011284000,
          "content" : "Very useful"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Awesome!

Alright, let me show you a couple of slightly more advanced use cases.

The first thing I will show you is that we can specify a query within the "source" parameter to only reindex documents that match the query.

## Reindex specific documents
```
POST /_reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "reviews",
    "query": {
      "match_all": { }
    }
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "reviews_new"
  }
}
```

That’s useful if we only want to reindex a subset of the documents that are stored within the source index.

Since we haven’t covered search queries yet, I have just specified the "match_all" query.

That doesn’t really make sense because that’s the same as not specifying a query.

Let’s make it a bit more interesting and meaningful by specifying a query that matches reviews with a rating of at least 4.0.

## Reindex only positive reviews
```
POST /_reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "reviews",
    "query": {
      "range": {
        "rating": {
          "gte": 4.0
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "reviews_new"
  }
}
```
Don’t worry about the specifics of the query, although it’s actually pretty straightforward.

Running this reindex query would only reindex reviews with a rating of at least 4.0.

Pretty cool, right?

Next, suppose that we want to remove a field.

As you know, we cannot delete a field mapping, so that is not an option.

As you also know, we can just leave out the field when indexing new documents and leave things as is.

However, if we have indexed lots of documents, perhaps we want to reclaim the disk space used by the field.

Remember that even though we stop supplying a value for a field when indexing new documents, the existing values are still maintained within a data structure.

Depending on how many values have been indexed, this may use a considerable amount of disk space that we could use for other things.

That’s of course assuming that we won’t need to query these values in the future.

The way we can do this is to use so-called "source filtering".

## Removing fields (source filtering)
```
POST /_reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "reviews",
    "_source": ["content", "created_at", "rating"]
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "reviews_new"
  }
}
```

By specifying an array of field names, only those fields are included for each document when they are indexed into the destination index.

In other words, any fields that you leave out will not be reindexed.

It’s possible to do the same thing with a script, but using the "_source" parameter is a simpler approach.

Sometimes you might want to rename a field, such as renaming the "content" field to "comment".

That can be done with a script consisting of just one statement.

# Changing a field's name
```
POST /_reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "reviews"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "reviews_new"
  },
  "script": {
    "source": """
      # Rename "content" field to "comment"
      ctx._source.comment = ctx._source.remove("content");
    """
  }
}
```

In case you were wondering, the "_source" key translates to a Java HashMap.

Besides removing a key, the "remove" method also returns its value, which is why the assignment works.

## Ignore reviews with ratings below 4.0
```
POST /_reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "reviews"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "reviews_new"
  },
  "script": {
    "source": """
      if (ctx._source.rating < 4.0) {
        ctx.op = "noop"; # Can also be set to "delete"
      }
    """
  }
}
```
Just as with scripted updates, it’s possible to specify the operation for the document within the script.

That’s done by assigning a value to the "op" property on the "ctx" variable.

You can assign a value of either "noop" or "delete".

In the case of "noop," the document will not be indexed into the destination index.

This is useful if you have some advanced logic to determine whether or not you need to reindex documents.

In this example we only reindex reviews with a rating of at least 4.0.

Note that it will usually be enough to define a query that matches the documents, but for advanced use cases that might not always be possible.

In this particular example, we could just as well have defined a query that expresses this constraint, which you actually saw how to do earlier.

That approach is actually much better in terms of performance, so you should always prefer specifying a query whenever possible.

Setting the operation to "delete" causes the document to be deleted within the destination index.

This can be useful because the document might already exist within that index.

In this lecture we reindexed documents into an empty index, but that might not always be the case; there is nothing preventing us from using the Reindex API to move documents into a non-empty index.

The API is just typically used for new indices when changing mappings, but it is not limited to just that use case.

That being said, you can typically achieve the same thing by using the Delete by Query API instead.

There are more parameters available for the Reindex API than the ones we covered in this lecture.

For example, you can define how to handle version conflicts, just as with the Update by Query API.

That’s because the Reindex API also makes a snapshot of the index before indexing documents into the destination index.

By default, the operation is aborted if a version conflict is encountered.

That’s fine when the destination index is empty, but that might not be the case.

Just like the Update by Query and Delete by Query APIs, the Reindex API also performs the operations in batches by using the Scroll API.

That’s essentially how it’s able to handle millions of documents efficiently.

You can define parameters that are related to throttling and limiting the number of requests per second.

That’s useful if you need to reindex a lot of documents on a production cluster and you want to limit the performance impact.

Anyway, that all becomes more complicated than what I want to cover here.

The point is that if you intend to use this API for millions of documents at once, then I recommend that you take a look at the documentation attached to this lecture.
