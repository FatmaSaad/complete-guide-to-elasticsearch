# Wrap up

That's the end of this section on managing documents.

This section was a mixture of you getting your hands dirty with Elasticsearch, and a bit of theory.

We covered all of the basic operations on documents, so you should now be comfortable with getting data into your Elasticsearch cluster.

You learned how routing works, and how Elasticsearch uses it when reading and writing documents.

We also talked about document versioning and how to do optimistic concurrency control, to avoid concurrency issues when updating documents.

Last but not least, you learned how to use the Bulk API to perform many operations in one request.

We used that API to import some test data that we will be using for the remainder of this course.

I'll see you in the next section!
