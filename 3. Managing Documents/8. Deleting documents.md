# Deleting documents

The last one we have yet to cover, is to delete documents.

You probably won't be surprised to hear that this is also super easy.

```
GET /products/_doc/101
```
you can see the query to retrieve a document, which you have seen quite a few times by now.

To remove the document instead of retrieving it, we simply change the HTTP verb to "DELETE".

```
DELETE /products/_doc/101
```
As you can see, things are often quite intuitive due to the REST API.

Let's run the query to delete the document.

```
{
  "_index" : "products",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "101",
  "_version" : 4,
  "result" : "deleted",
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 2,
    "successful" : 1,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "_seq_no" : 10,
  "_primary_term" : 1
}

```

The document has now been deleted, and we should no longer be able to retrieve it.

```
GET /products/_doc/101
```
And indeed, the document is no longer found.
```
{
  "_index" : "products",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "101",
  "found" : false
}
```
As with updating documents, it is also possible to delete documents that match a given query,

but we will look at that a bit later.
